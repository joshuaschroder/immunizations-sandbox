<p>This is an excellent place to describe what the program does. Take this opportunity to describe the program's mission as well as the intended population that the program serves, and explain how this helps to better the State of Texas as a whole. Keep in mind that this description should make sense to people who know absolutely nothing about the program.</p>

<p>You may wish to provide details about specific statistics, disease information, etc. here. If there is any other important details about Texas regulations, program funding, or other inter-related programs, you may want to mention them here as well.</p>

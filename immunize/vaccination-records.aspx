<h2>Child Vaccination Records</h2>

<p><strong><em>NOTE: Vaccination records are NOT available to view online by parents/legal guardian.</em></strong></p>

<p>If you have consented for your child's vaccination records to be sent to <a title="ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/immunize/ImmTrac/default.shtm">ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry</a>, please print out the <a title="Authorization to Release Official Immunization History form" href="/immunize/immtrac/forms.shtm">Authorization to Release Official Immunization History form</a>, and submit it via fax or U.S. mail to the ImmTrac Group. If the requested immunization records are in the registry, you will receive a copy as indicated in the release form.</p>

<p>If you did not give consent, you will have to contact either your private physician or the local city/county health clinic where your child received the immunizations.</p>

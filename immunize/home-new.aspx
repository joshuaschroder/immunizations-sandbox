<p>The goal of the DSHS Immunization Unit is to increase the number of persons vaccinated within the State of Texas, raise awareness of the diseases that vaccines prevent, and educate the public about vaccine safety. We do this through administration of the Texas immunization registry (ImmTrac), which provides access to immunization records, establishment of school immunization rules, and administration of the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net programs, which provide low-cost vaccines to eligible children and adults.</p>

	<h2>Pentacel&#174; Vaccine Delay</h2>
	<p>December 5, 2015</p>
	<p>The Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) Program was notified on November 30, 2015, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding a temporary manufacturing delay of Sanofi Pastuer's Pentacel&#174; vaccine (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Inactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine). The vaccine delay will result in immediate vaccine allocation of this project to all VFC programs nationwide. The vaccine delay is anticipated to last through the summer of 2016.</p>
	<p>In order to ensure that all TVFC providers have access to this vaccine over the next few months, TVFC provider Maximum Stock Levels (MSLs) for Pentacel&#174; will be reduced immediately. However, further vaccine allocation reductions could be implemented based on manufacture and CDC guidance. </p>
	<p>Options to reduce the use of Pentacel&#174; include the use of single vaccines for some populations and the use of alternative combination vaccines. Providers should continue to follow the recommended immunization schedule and ensure that patients receive all recommended doses of DTaP, Hib, and polio vaccines. </p>

<p>The Adult Safety Net (ASN) Program supplies publicly-purchased vaccine at no cost to enrolled providers. The program was created by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Immunization Unit to increase access to vaccination services in Texas for uninsured adults, thereby raising the immunization coverage levels and improving the health of Texans.</p>

<p>Like infants and children, adults are also at risk for contracting vaccine-preventable diseases. In addition to becoming severely ill, infected adults risk spreading these diseases to infants who are too young to be vaccinated. The solution is to vaccinate our adult population to prevent infection with one of these potentially devastating diseases.</p>

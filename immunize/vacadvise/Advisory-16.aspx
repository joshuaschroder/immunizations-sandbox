	Revised Recommendations for Rotavirus Vaccines</b>
</p>
<p><em>The goal of the Vaccine Advisory is to disseminate, in a timely manner, practical information related to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, and the vaccine programs managed by the Immunization Branch.The Immunization Branch welcomes readers&#8217; input to improve the contents of this document. </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>On March 22, 2010, the FDA called for a temporary halt to the use of Rotarix&#174; vaccine after DNA from porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) was found in the vaccine, which is manufactured by Glaxo SmithKline. </p>
<p>On May 6, 2010, the FDA indicated that preliminary studies showed the RotaTeq&#174; vaccine, manufactured by Merck & Co, Inc., contained fragments of DNA from PCV1 and from a related porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). </p>
<p>On May 7, 2010, the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) met to discuss these vaccines. The advisory committee recommended resuming the use of Rotarix&#174; and not taking any action with RotaTeq&#174;. </p>

<h2>1) Summary of New Recomendations for Rotavirus Vaccines</h2>
<p>On May 14, 2010, the FDA announced an update to its recommendations for rotavirus vaccines for the prevention of the disease in infants. Based on careful evaluation of a variety of scientific information, the FDA has determined it is appropriate for clinicians and health care professionals to resume the use of Rotarix&#174; and to continue the use of RotaTeq&#174;.</p>
<p>This recommendation supersedes the FDA&#8217;s previous recommendation from March 22, 2010, which called for health care providers to suspend use of Rotarix&#174;.</p>
<p>The FDA also recommends that clinicians and public health professionals inform parents of the findings of PCV DNA or PCV in rotavirus vaccines, and that there is no evidence that these findings pose a safety risk in humans. Both the prescribing information and patient labeling will be revised to include this information.</p>
<p>Details of the updated FDA recommendations can be found on the <a title="FDA Update on Recommendations for the Use of Rotavirus Vaccines" href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm212140.htm">FDA Update on Recommendations for the Use of Rotavirus Vaccines</a> webpage.</p>

<h2>2) Texas Vaccines for Children program (TVFC)</h2>
<p>Beginning September 1, 2010, the Texas Vaccines for Children program will fulfill orders for both Rotarix&#174; and RotaTeq&#174; according to provider choices selected earlier in the year. If a provider failed to choose vaccines by the July 31, 2010 deadline, RotaTeq&#174; will be sent as the state&#8217;s default vaccine. </p>

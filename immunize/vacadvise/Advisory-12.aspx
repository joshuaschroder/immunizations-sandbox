		Advisory No. 12. Kinrix - The New Combined IPV and DTaP Vaccine
	</b>
</p>
<p><em>The goal of the Vaccine Advisory is to disseminate, in a timely manner, practical information related to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, and the vaccine programs managed by the Immunization Branch.The Immunization Branch welcomes readers&#8217; input to improve the contents of this document. </em></p>

<hr/>
<p>On June 26, 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to add the newly licensed combination DTaP-IPV (Kinrix) vaccine as a routinely recommended vaccine. Kinrix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, is designed to protect children 4-6 years of age against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio. This advisory summarizes the indications for Kinrix and provides guidance from the ACIP for its use. The full ACIP recommendations may be found in <a title="Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Oct. 3, 2008" href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5739a4.htm?s_cid=mm5739a4_e">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Oct. 3, 2008</a>

<h2>1) Background </h2>
<p>On June 24, 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed (DTaP) and inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccine, Kinrix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. Kinrix is licensed for use as a booster dose in children aged 4-6 years, following a series of Infanrix and/or Pediarix.</p>
<p>On June 26, 2008, the ACIP endorsed the licensed indications and offered the following guidance, summarized below, for use of DTaP-IPV (Kinrix) vaccine.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="2" name="2"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>2) Summary of ACIP recommendations</h2>
<p>Indications and guidance for use of Kinrix vaccine follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Kinrix (DTaP-IPV) is indicated for use as the fifth dose of DTaP and fourth dose of IPV in children aged 4-6 years who received DTaP (Infanrix) and/or DTaP-Hepatitis B-IPV (Pediarix) as the first 3 doses and DTaP (Infanrix) as the fourth dose. </li>
	<li>Kinrix should not be administered to children aged &lt; 4 years or =7 years; however, if DTaPIPV (Kinrix) is inadvertently administered for an earlier dose of the DTaP and/or IPV series, the dose should be counted as valid and does not need to be repeated provided minimum interval requirements have been met. </li>
	<li>Data are limited on the safety and immunogenicity of interchanging DTaP vaccines from different manufacturers ACIP recommends that, whenever feasible, the same manufacturer&#8217;s DTaP vaccines should be used for each dose in the series; however vaccination should not be deferred because the type of DTaP previously administered is unavailable or unknown. </li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Texas Vaccines for Children program</h2>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2009, Kinrix became available through the Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) Program, and is approved for the booster dose at age 4-6 years.</p>
<p>Kinrix vaccine may be ordered using the TVFC Biological Order Form (C-68). The number of doses requested should be consistent with the 4-6 year old patient population as it relates to ordering frequency. Inventory and usage should be submitted monthly along with other vaccines using the Monthly Biological Report (C-33).  A <a title="Immunize Texas Order Form" href="/immunize/docs/ec-33.pdf">revised C-33</a> that includes Kinrix can be found on the <a title="Immunize Texas Order Form" href="https://secure.immunizetexasorderform.com/default.asp">Immunize Texas Order Form</a>. Providers should begin using this new version immediately. The CPT code is 90696.</p>
<p>To access complete prescribing information, please reference the  
<a title="Kinrix vaccine package insert (PDF)" href="http://www.fda.gov/cber/label/kinrixLB.pdf">Kinrix vaccine package insert (PDF)</a>. For other questions, contact your Health Service Region, Local Health Department, or TVFC consultant.</p>

<h2>4) ImmTrac</h2>
<p>ImmTrac users can report the DTaP and IPV (Diphtheria, Tetnus, Acellular Pertussis/inactive Polio) vaccine, Kinrix, using the ImmTrac code &#8220;DTaP/IPV.&#8221; Although ImmTrac can record Kinrix vaccine doses administered, and doses will be reflected on the client immunization history, the ImmTrac immunization scheduler will not generate recommendations for Kinrix vaccine at this time. Providers should consult ACIP recommendations to determine when the
<br/>Kinrix vaccine should be administered.</p>
<p>For more information about ImmTrac, please visit

<h2>5) Texas school and child-care facilities requirements for Kinrix vaccine</h2>
<p>Kinrix (DTaP-IPV) vaccine can be given to children 4-6 years of age as the fifth dose in the DTaP series and the fourth dose in the IPV series, following a series of Infanrix and/or Pediarix.</p>

<h2>6) Epidemiology and surveillance</h2>
<p>Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an acute, highly infectious, toxin-mediated disease caused by the bacterium <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>. Disease in adolescents and adults may be milder and go undetected in these individuals. However, they are still capable of transmitting the disease to other susceptible individuals, especially those most vulnerable, infants. Pertussis is the second most commonly reported vaccine-preventable disease in Texas. In 2008, approximately 1,900 cases of pertussis and 4 infant deaths due to pertussis occurred in Texas. This is an increase from the previous year (1,051 cases, 0 deaths). Pertussis typically peaks in three year cycles. The majority of cases occur among infants younger than 1 year of age and adults. Pertussis is a reportable condition in Texas. All suspected cases are to be reported to the health department within 1 working day. To report pertussis, please call (800) 705-8868.</p>

<h2>7) Reporting vaccine adverse events</h2>
<p>Clinically significant adverse events following vaccination should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).</p>
<p>Adverse events from privately purchased vaccine may be reported directly to  <a title="VAERS" href="http://vaers.hhs.gov/">VAERS</a>. Secure web-based reporting is available on the VAERS website. Contact 800-VAC-RXNS for forms and information.</p>
<p>In Texas, reports of events following vaccination at public health clinics or with vaccine provided through public funding such as the Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) program should be reported to:</p>

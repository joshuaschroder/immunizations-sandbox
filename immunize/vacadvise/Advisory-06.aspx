<h2>1) ACIP Recommendation for the 2007 - 2008 Influenza </h2>
<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza vaccination for groups at increased risk for severe complications from influenza, or for influenza-associated clinic, emergency department, or hospital visits.</p>
<p>ACIP emphasizes that immunization providers should offer influenza vaccine and schedule immunization clinics throughout the influenza season (see Timing of Vaccination).</p>

<a id="1-1" name="1-1"></a>
<h3>ACIP recommends annual influenza vaccination for people at high risk for complications from the flu, including:</h3>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Children aged 6 months until their 5th birthday,</li>
	<li>Pregnant women,</li>
	<li>People 50 years of age and older,</li>
	<li>People of any age with certain chronic medical conditions, and</li>
	<li>People who live in nursing homes and other long term care facilities.</li>
	<li>People who live with or care for those at high risk for complications from flu, including:
		<ul>
			<li>Household contacts of persons at high risk for complications from the flu (see above)</li>
			<li>Household contacts and out of home caregivers of children less than 6 months of age (these children are too young to be vaccinated)</li>
			<li>Health care workers.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Anyone who wants to decrease their risk of influenza.</li>
</ul>

<a class="bookmark" name="1-2" id="1-2"></a>
<h3>Use of the Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine</h3>
<p>Vaccination with the nasal-spray flu vaccine is an option for healthy persons aged 2-49 years (read 
<a href="/immunize/vacadvise/VA_06_FluMist_PR.pdf">Press Release on expanded use of FluMist - PDF</a>) who are not pregnant, even healthy persons who live with or care for those in a high risk group. The one exception is healthy persons who care for persons with severely weakened immune systems who require a protected environment; these healthy persons should get the inactivated vaccine.</p>

<a class="bookmark" name="1-3" id="1-3"></a>
<h3>Who Should Not Be Vaccinated</h3>
<p>Some people should not be vaccinated without first consulting a physician. They include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>People who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs.</li>
	<li>People who have had a severe reaction to an influenza vaccination in the past.</li>
	<li>People who developed <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/guillainbarre.htm">Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome</a> (GBS) within 6 weeks of getting an influenza vaccine previously.</li>
	<li>Children less than 6 months of age (influenza vaccine is not approved for use in this age group).</li>
	<li>People who have a moderate or severe illness with a fever should wait to get vaccinated until their symptoms lessen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ACIP lists primary changes and updates contained in the 2007 recommendations, which include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ACIP reemphasizes the importance of administering 2 doses of vaccine to all children aged 6 months&#8211;8 years if they have not been vaccinated previously at any time with either LAIV (doses separated by >6 weeks) or TIV (doses separated by >4 weeks), on the basis of accumulating data indicating that 2 doses are required for protection in these children (see Vaccine Efficacy, Effectiveness, and Safety).</li>
	<li>ACIP recommends that children aged 6 months&#8211;8 years who received only 1 dose in their first year of vaccination receive 2 doses the following year (see Vaccine Efficacy, Effectiveness, and Safety).</li>
	<li>ACIP reiterates a previous recommendation that all persons, including school-aged children, who want to reduce the risk of becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting influenza to others should be vaccinated (see Box and Recommendations for Using TIV and LAIV During the 2007&#8211;08 Influenza Season).</li>
	<li>ACIP recommends that health-care administrators consider the level of vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel (HCP) to be one measure of a patient safety quality program and implement policies to encourage HCP vaccination (e.g., obtaining signed statements from HCP who decline influenza vaccination) (see Additional Information Regarding Vaccination of Specific Populations).</li>
	<li>The 2007&#8211;2008 trivalent vaccine strains are A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1)-like (new for this season), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like viruses. (see Recommendations for Using TIV and LAIV During the 2007&#8211;08 Influenza Season).</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<h2>2) National Supply Update</h2>
<p>A record number of 132 million doses of influenza vaccine have been projected for the 2007-2008 influenza season. All providers are urged to vaccinate their patients until vaccine is no longer available or it expires. CDC provides a number of resources to keep health care professionals up-to-date on influenza vaccine and its availability. Visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/">CDC Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Resources for Health Professionals</a> webpage for the most current information on influenza vaccine supply issues. The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cber/flu/flu.htm">FDA Influenza Virus Vaccine Safety &amp; Availability webpage</a> also provides information on influenza vaccine and the number of vaccine lots released.</p>
<p>While flu vaccine orders are generally placed during the first quarter, health care providers seeking flu vaccine may contact the major distributors to check availability. Flu Supply News is provided by a voluntary group of flu vaccine distributors who are committed to working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that seasonal flu vaccine is efficiently distributed. The goal of the initiative is to educate and inform stakeholders on the integral role of distribution and the integrity of the flu vaccine supply chain.</p>

<a class="bookmark" id="7" name="7"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>7) Texas school or daycare requirements for the influenza vaccine</h2>
<p>Currently the influenza vaccine is not required for school or daycare attendance. The close of the 80th Legislative Session resulted in the passage of House Bill (HB) 3184, which requires the DSHS to publish information about the benefits of annual vaccination against influenza; and, together with the Department of Family &amp; Protective Services (DFPS), ensure the information is annually distributed to parents of children attending child-care in August or September. A newly created <em>Flu Fact Sheet for Child-Care Settings</em> will be mailed in September to child-care facility centers in Texas for distribution to all enrolled children. Information on the immunization requirements for children attending child-care facilities, flu information targeting children, and the recommended immunizations can also be found on the updated web page under the heading Information for Child-Care Facilities.</p>
<p>Please visit the <a href="/immunize/school/">School and Child-Care Requirements</a> webpage for these materials.</p>

<a class="bookmark" id="8" name="8"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>8) ImmTrac</h2>
<p>ImmTrac users can report flu vaccines administered using the ImmTrac code &#8220;<strong>Influenza</strong>.&#8221; Although ImmTrac can record flu vaccine doses administered, and doses will be reflected on the client immunization history, the ImmTrac immunization scheduler will not generate recommendations for Influenza vaccine at this time. Providers should consult ACIP recommendations to determine when administration of Influenza vaccine is recommended. Please visit the  <a href="http://www.ImmTrac.com">ImmTrac</a> webpage for more information.</p>

<a class="bookmark" id="9" name="9"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>9) Surveillance Update</h2>
<p>The official reporting period for the 2007-2008 influenza season begins October 1, 2007. The State of Texas utilizes a sentinel surveillance system for influenza. Activity is determined based on data from multiple sources, including reports of influenza-like illness from clinical practitioners who participate in the Sentinel Provider Surveillance Network (SPSN), specimens submitted to the DSHS laboratory for viral culture, and outbreak reports from hospitals, long-term care facilities, and schools. Please visit the <a href="/idcu/disease/influenza/surveillance/spsn/">Sentinel Provider Surveillance Network</a> for more information. If you are interested in participating in the SPSN, please contact Irene Brown, SPSN coordinator at (512) 458-7676. 	<a href="/idcu/disease/influenza/surveillance/">Flu Activity Reports</a> are posted online.</p>

<h2>1) Summary of recommendations</h2>
<p>The ACIP voted to recommend that a newly licensed vaccine designed to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV) be routinely given to girls at the age of 11-12 years. The ACIP recommendation also supports vaccination of females from 13 to 26 years of age who have not been previously vaccinated, and allows for vaccination of girls beginning at nine years. The vaccine should be administered in a series of three intra-muscular injections over a six-month period. The second and third doses should be given two and six months after the first dose. The vaccine can be administered at the same visit as other age-appropriate vaccines, such as Tdap, Td, MCV4, and hepatitis B vaccines. </p>
<p>HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women. On average, there are 9,710 new cases and 3,700 deaths from cervical cancer in the United States each year. The vaccine is the first developed to prevent cervical cancer, precancerous genital lesions and genital warts due to HPV. The vaccine is highly effective against four types of HPV virus, including two that cause about 70 percent of cervical cancer. Those who have not acquired HPV would get the full benefits of the vaccine.</p>

<h2>3) Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) program</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The ACIP passed a resolution to include HPV vaccine in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. VFC-eligible children nine through 18 years of age are entitled to receive VFC vaccine. </li>
	<li>The HPV vaccine is expected to become available to the <a title="TVFC Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/">TVFC program</a> later this year. </li>

<h2>4) ImmTrac</h2>
<p>ImmTrac has been updated to record HPV vaccines administered. The ImmTrac code for the Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine is “HPV-Quad.” Although ImmTrac can record HPV vaccine doses administered, the ImmTrac immunization scheduler will not generate recommendations for HPV at this time. For more information about ImmTrac, visit <a title="http://www.immtrac.com/" href="http://www.immtrac.com/">www.ImmTrac.com</a>. </p>

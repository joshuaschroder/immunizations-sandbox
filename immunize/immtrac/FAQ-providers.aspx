<p><strong>What Is ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry, is a no-cost service offered by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). It is a secure and confidential registry available to all Texans. ImmTrac safely consolidates and stores immunization information electronically in one centralized system.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="2" name="2"></a>
<p><strong>Why Should I Use ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>The Texas Legislature has mandated the use of ImmTrac for vaccines given to children under 18 years of age. Texas Health and Safety code, Chapter 161 states that all health care providers who administer an immunization to an individual younger than 18 years of age must provide data elements regarding an immunization to the department.</p>

<p><strong>How Does ImmTrac Benefit My Patients?</strong></p>
<p>Your patients will no longer have to retain copies of vaccination records for school admission or travel abroad. Schools can now verify a child's vaccination status online without the need for additional documentation.</p>

<p><strong>How Does ImmTrac Help Improve My Practice?</strong></p>
<p>ImmTrac helps prevent missed vaccinations and over-vaccinations. Each patient's immunization information is consolidated into one electronic record in the registry, even when they are vaccinated by multiple providers. Providers can quickly and easily access any patient's vaccination history, allowing for better continuity of care.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="5" name="5"></a>
<p><strong>Are There Any Costs Associated With Use and Administration of ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>Although ImmTrac is a no-cost service, providers should be prepared to invest some time involved in the administration of the system. This may include labor associated with recording patient information, managing vaccine inventories, or integrating with your existing EHR/EMR software. For further information, please see the <a title="Electronic Transfer Standards for Providers" href="/immunize/immtrac/forms.shtm#11-11445">Electronic Transfer Standards for Providers</a> document on the ImmTrac forms page.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="6" name="6"></a>
<p><strong>Does ImmTrac Work With My Electronic Health Record (EHR) System or Medical Billing Software?</strong></p>
<p>ImmTrac can integrate with any EHR/EMR or medical billing software using the HL7 data transfer specification. Although DSHS does not provide this layer of connectivity, we offer technical specifications and guidance for software developers as well as a toll-free help line.</p>

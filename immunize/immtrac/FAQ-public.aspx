<p><strong>What Is ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>ImmTrac is the official Texas immunization registry from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). It is a secure, confidential registry that stores immunization records electronically in one centralized system at no cost.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="2" name="2"></a>
<p><strong>What Are the Benefits?</strong></p>
<p>You can safely store your immunization records in ImmTrac at no cost to you. Your records will be kept secure and confidential. Even if, you got one vaccine at your doctor’s office and another at your local pharmacy, you can electronically store all your immunization records in ImmTrac. Then, you will have one immunization history. You can request a copy of your immunization history when you need it for college entrance requirements, military enlistment, travel, employment in health and safety fields, and other instances</p>
<p>Your ImmTrac authorized health-care provider can access your immunization history and make sure you are not over or under vaccinated. This way, you will be fully protected against vaccine-preventable diseases and save money by not paying for vaccines you do not need.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="3" name="3"></a>
<p><strong>Who Can Be a Part of ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone in Texas who would like to keep his or her immunization records in a secure and confidential electronic system can register.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="4" name="4"></a>
<p><strong>What If I'm Already Registered in ImmTrac as a Child?</strong></p>
<p>If your immunization records were in ImmTrac as a child, you can keep them in ImmTrac as an adult. You must sign an ImmTrac Adult Consent Form between your 18th and 19th birthday to continue to keep your record in ImmTrac. If you do not sign this form by your 19th birthday, your record will be deleted.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="5" name="5"></a>
<p><strong>How Long Will a Child's Immunization History Remain in ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>When an ImmTrac client turns 18 years old, the client is legally an adult. The client must sign an ImmTrac Adult Consent form in the time between the client’s 18th and 19th birthday to keep the immunization records in ImmTrac that were entered in as a child in ImmTrac for a lifetime. If an ImmTrac client does not sign an ImmTrac Adult Consent Form by the client’s 19th birthday, the client’s ImmTrac ID, including immunization records, will be deleted and cannot be recovered in ImmTrac.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="6" name="6"></a>
<p><strong>How Can I Register with ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>If you have never registered with ImmTrac, either as a child or as an adult, you can:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Download</strong> and complete the <a title="ImmTrac Adult Registration Form (F11-13366)" href="/immunize/immtrac/forms.shtm#EF11-13366">ImmTrac Adult Registration Form (F11-13366)</a> from the ImmTrac forms page.<br/></li>
	<li><strong>Gather and make copies</strong> of all your official immunization records.<br/></li>
	<li><strong>Send in</strong> your completed ImmTrac Adult Consent Form and copies of your official immunization records to your authorized health-care provider, local health department (LHD), DSHS health service region (HSR) office or the Department of State Health Services ImmTrac office.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="7" name="7"></a>
<p><strong>Do I Have to Be up to Date on My Vaccines to Register?</strong></p>
<p>No. You do not have to be up to date with all your vaccines to register with ImmTrac. You may want to review the Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule with a health- care provider to determine which vaccines you still need. Even though you are a young adult, there are more recommended adult vaccines now then when you were a child. Go to <a title="www.VaccinesForEveryone.com" href="http://www.VaccinesForEveryone.com">www.VaccinesForEveryone.com</a> or <a title="www.ImmTrac4everyone.com" href="http://www.ImmTrac4everyone.com">www.ImmTrac4everyone.com</a> to download the <em>Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule</em>.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="8" name="8"></a>
<p><strong>How Do I Find out If I Am Already Signed up for ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>Fill out and submit an <a title="Authorization to Release ImmTrac History form" href="/immunize/immtrac/forms.shtm#records">Authorization to Release ImmTrac History form (F11-11406)</a>. ImmTrac will look in the registry and inform you if your records are part of the registry.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="9" name="9"></a>
<p><strong>Who Can Access ImmTrac?</strong></p>
<p>An ImmTrac client can access ImmTrac by requesting a paper copy of your immunization record from an authorized health-care provider, local health department, health service region, or the Texas Department of State Health Services ImmTrac office. An ImmTrac client does not have direct access to the ImmTrac registry. Just like you cannot view your medical records online, you cannot view your ImmTrac records online either. This is to ensure the confidentiality and security of the immunization records.</p>

<hr/>
<a class="bookmark" title="10" name="10"></a>
<p><strong>Are All Health-Care Providers Part of the ImmTrac Registry?</strong></p>
<p>No. Only health-care providers who are registered with ImmTrac are part of ImmTrac as an authorized provider. It is optional for all health- care providers to be a part of ImmTrac.</p>

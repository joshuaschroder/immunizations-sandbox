<p>The NIS is conducted quarterly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the vaccination coverage level among children 19 through 35 months of age. NIS utilizes a random digit dial survey to collect immunization information from households with eligible children. For completeness and verification, immunization data are also requested from vaccination providers with consent of parents.</p>

<p>Results for the NIS conducted from January through December of 2003 showed that the 4-3-1 vaccination coverage level (four or more doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, and one or more doses of any measles-containing vaccine) for children aged 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 78.1 (+3.8%). The 4-3-1-3 level (4-3-1 plus 3 or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine) for the same age group in Texas was 77.2 (+3.8%). Children participating in this study were born from February 2000 through May 2002.</p>

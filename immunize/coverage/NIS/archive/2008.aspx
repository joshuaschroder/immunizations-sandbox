<p>The NIS is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the vaccination coverage level among children 19 through 35 months of age and adolescents 13 through 17 years of age. NIS utilizes a random digit dial survey to collect immunization information from households with eligible participants. For completeness and verification, immunization data are also requested from vaccination providers with consent of parents.</p>

<h2>Children 19-35 Months of Age</h2>
<p>Results for the 2008 NIS conducted from January through December of 2008 showed that the 4-3-1-3-3-1 (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, three or more doses of Hepatitis B, and one or more doses of Varicella) vaccination coverage level for children aged 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 77.8 (±4.7). The 4-3-1-3-3 (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and three or more doses of Hepatitis B) vaccination coverage level for this same age group in Texas was 78.6 (±4.7). The survey assessed the immunization histories of approximately 1,500 children in Texas aged 19 through 35 months.  These children were born between January 2005 and June 2007.</p>

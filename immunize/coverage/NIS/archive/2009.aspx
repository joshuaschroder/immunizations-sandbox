?>

<p>The NIS and NIS-Teen are conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the vaccination coverage level among children 19 through 35 months of age and adolescents 13 through 17 years of age. NIS and NIS-Teen utilize a random digit dial survey to collect immunization information from households with eligible participants. For completeness and verification, immunization data are also requested from vaccination providers with consent of parents.</p>

<h2>Children 19-35 Months of Age</h2>
<p>Results for the 2009 NIS conducted from January through December of 2009 showed that the 4-3-1-3-3-1-4 (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, three or more doses of Hepatitis B,  one or more doses of Varicella, and 4 or more doses of pneumococcal) vaccination coverage level for children aged 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 67.6 (±5.3). However, 4-3-1-3-3-1-4 estimates were affected by the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) shortage that occurred from December 2007 to September 2009, the temporary recommendation to suspend Hib booster dose at a period when 70% of the children in the NIS would have been eligible for the booster, and new measurements of Hib coverage that take into account the brand of vaccine used. As a result, estimates for the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series measure dropped nationally and in all states, and these drops mostly reflect the deferral of the Hib booster dose, and thus are not useful for assessing changes in coverage for the series.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">Results for the 2009 NIS showed that the 4-3-1-0-3-1-4 (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, zero doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, three or more doses of Hepatitis B, one or more doses of Varicella, and 4 or more doses of pneumococcal) vaccination coverage level for children age 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 71.3 (±5.0). The survey assessed the immunization histories of approximately 1,266 children in Texas aged 19 through 35 months.  These children were born between January 2006 and July 2008.</p>

<h2>Adolescents 13-17 years</h2>
<p>The 2009 NIS-Teen survey assessed the immunization histories of 20,066 (10,445 males and 9,621 females) adolescents in the US aged 13 to 17 years of age.  These adolescents were born between January 1991 and February 1997. </p>

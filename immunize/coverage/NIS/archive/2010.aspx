?>

<p>The NIS and NIS-Teen are conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the vaccination coverage level among children 19 through 35 months of age and adolescents 13 through 17 years of age. NIS and NIS-Teen utilize a random digit dial survey to collect immunization information from households with eligible participants. For completeness and verification, immunization data are also requested from vaccination providers with consent of parents.</p>

<h2>Children 19-35 Months of Age</h2>
<p>Results for the 2010 NIS conducted from January through December of 2010 showed that the 4-3-1-3-3-1-4 (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, three or more doses of Hepatitis B, one or more doses of Varicella, and 4 or more doses of pneumococcal) vaccination coverage level for children aged 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 70.1(±4.1). The Hib shortage that occurred from December 2007 to September 2009, temporary suspension of the Hib booster dose at 12-15 months, and a new method for measuring Hib coverage had a major effect on coverage estimates in most states in 2010 compared to 2009.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">Results for the 2010 NIS showed that the 4-3-1-0-3-1-4 (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, zero doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, three or more doses of Hepatitis B, one or more doses of Varicella, and 4 or more doses of pneumococcal) vaccination coverage level for children age 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 70.9 (±4.1). The survey assessed the immunization histories of approximately 1,379 children in Texas aged 19 through 35 months. These children were born between January 2007 and July 2009.</p>

<p>The NIS is conducted quarterly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the vaccination coverage level among children 19 through 35 months of age. NIS utilizes a random digit dial survey to collect immunization information from households with eligible children. For completeness and verification, immunization data are also requested from vaccination providers with consent of parents.</p>

<p>Results for the 2007 NIS conducted from January through December of 2007 showed that the 4-3-1-3-3-1 vaccination coverage level (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, three or more doses of Hepatitis B, and one or more doses of Varicella) for children aged 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 77.3 (±3.8%). The 4-3-1-3-3 vaccination coverage level (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and three or more doses of Hepatitis B) for this same age group in Texas was 78.2 (±3.8%). The 4-3-1 level (four or more doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, and one or more doses of any measles-containing vaccine) for the same age group in Texas was 80.9 (±3.6%). Children participating in this study were born from January 2004 through July 2006.</p>

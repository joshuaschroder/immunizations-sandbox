	<h2>2013 National Immunization Survey</h2>
	<p>The NIS is a national survey conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess immunization levels among pre-school children 19 through 35 months old.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">What is the National Immunization Survey (NIS)?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The NIS is the only population-based survey to provide national, state, local area, and territorial estimates of vaccination coverage among children aged 19–35 months in the United States.  The NIS uses a quarterly, random-digit–dialed cellular and landline telephone number followed by a mail survey of the children’s vaccination providers to collect provider-confirmed vaccination information. Data are weighted to be representative of the population of children 19-35 months of age, and are adjusted for multiple phone lines, mixed telephone lines (ie. landline and cellular), household nonresponse and the exclusion of phoneless households. There is another survey, called the NIS-Teen, that assesses immunization levels among teens 13-17 years of age.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">What is the importance of the NIS?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The NIS provides national and state estimates of vaccination coverage, including new vaccines as they are licensed and recommended for use.  The survey also tracks progress towards <a title="Healthy People 2020 goals" href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/immunization-and-infectious-diseases/objectives">Healthy People 2020 goals</a>. The 2013 NIS is a measure of the effectiveness of strategies and activities that were in place up to three years ago.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">What children were included in the 2013 NIS data?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The survey assessed the immunization histories of 13,611 children in the United States, aged 19 through 35 months with provider-reported vaccination records.  These children were born January 2010 through May 2012. </p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">How is vaccine coverage defined?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">As in 2012, the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series was reported which includes the full Hib vaccine.  The 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series is an overall measure that encompasses many vaccines that are recommended for children.</p>
	
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series includes the following vaccines:</p>
	<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
		<li>4 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP),</li>
		<li>3 doses of Polio,</li>
		<li>1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR),</li>
		<li>3 doses of Hib or 4 depending on the product,</li>
		<li>3 doses of hepatitis B,</li>
		<li>1 dose of varicella, and</li>
		<li>4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The 2013 NIS also focuses on the more recently recommended vaccines (i.e., hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, hepatitis A vaccine, PCV, and rotavirus vaccine) for children aged 19–35 months.</p>

	<h2>2013 National Immunization Survey - Teen</h2>
	<p>The NIS-Teen is a national survey conducted annually by the CDC to assess immunization levels for adolescents 13-17 years of age.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">What is the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen)?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">This study collects data by interviewing households in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and selected areas for oversampling. The interviews are conducted by telephone, with households selected at random. To assure the accuracy and precision of the vaccination coverage estimates, immunization data for surveyed adolescents are also collected through a mail survey of their pediatricians, family physicians, and other health care providers. The parents and guardians of eligible adolescents are asked during the telephone interview for consent to contact the adolescents’ vaccination providers. Types of immunizations, dates of administration, and additional data about facility characteristics are requested from immunization providers that are identified during the telephone survey of households. The <a title="NIS-Teen’s estimates of adolescent vaccination coverage" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/imz-coverage.html">NIS-Teen’s estimates of adolescent vaccination coverage</a> reflect a comparison of information provided by both surveyed households and immunization providers. There is another survey, called the NIS, that assesses immunization levels among children 19-35 months of age.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">What is the importance of the NIS-Teen?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The NIS-Teen was established to provide an on-going, consistent data set for analyzing vaccination levels among adolescents in the United States (US) and to disseminate this information to interested public health partners. The NIS-Teen provides national and state estimates of vaccination coverage, including new vaccines as they are licensed and recommended for use. It also helps track progress towards the <a title="Healthy People 2020 goals" href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/immunization-and-infectious-diseases/objectives">Healthy People 2020 goals</a>.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">What adolescents were included in the 2013 NIS-Teen?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The survey assessed the immunization histories of 18,264 adolescents (9,554 males and 8,710 females) aged 13-17 years in the US.  These adolescents were born between January 1995 and February 2001. In Texas, 1,112 adolescents were surveyed for the 2013 NIS-Teen.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">What vaccines were included in the 2013 NIS-Teen?</h3>
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The following vaccine doses routinely recommended for adolescents were measured in the 2013 NIS-Teen.</p>
	
	<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
		<li>≥1 Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine, or Tdap, or tetanus-unknown vaccine on or after age 10 years.</li>
		<li>≥1 dose of MenACWY or meningococcal-unknown type vaccine.</li>
		<li>≥1 dose of HPV vaccine, either quadrivalent or bivalent. Percentage reported among females and males separately.</li>
		<li>≥2 doses of HPV vaccine, either quadrivalent or bivalent. Percentage reported among females and males separately. </li>
		<li>≥3 doses of HPV vaccine, either quadrivalent or bivalent. Percentage reported among females and males separately.</li>
		<li>HPV vaccine 3 dose series completion (among those initiating series). Percentage reported among females and males separately.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p style="margin-left:20px;">The NIS-Teen also measures coverage for the following catchup-schedule vaccines:</p>
	
	<ul style="margin-left:20px;">
		<li>≥2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine</li>
		<li>≥ 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine</li>
		<li>≥ 1 dose of varicella (Chickenpox) vaccine</li>
		<li>≥ 2 doses of varicella (Chickenpox) vaccine[LC2] </li>

<p>The NIS is conducted quarterly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the vaccination coverage level among children 19 through 35 months of age. NIS utilizes a random digit dial survey to collect immunization information from households with eligible children. For completeness and verification, immunization data are also requested from vaccination providers with consent of parents.</p>

<p>Results for the NIS conducted from January through December of 2006 showed that the 4-3-1-3-3-1 vaccination coverage level (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, three or more doses of Hepatitis B, and one or more doses of Varicella) for children aged 19 through 35 months in the state of Texas was 74.7 (±3.7%). The 4-3-1-3-3 vaccination coverage level (four or more doses of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of Poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any Measles-containing vaccine, three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and three or more doses of Hepatitis B) for this same age group in Texas was 76.7 (±3.6%). The 4-3-1 level (four or more doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, three or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, and one or more doses of any measles-containing vaccine) for the same age group in Texas was 79.5 (±3.4%). Children participating in this study were born from January 2003 through June 2005.</p>

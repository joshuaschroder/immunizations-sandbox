		<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">About the National Immunization Survey (NIS)</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:40px;">The NIS is a national survey conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess immunization levels among pre-school children 19 through 35 months old. The NIS is the only population-based survey to provide national, state, local area, and territorial estimates of vaccination coverage among children aged 19-35 months in the United States. The NIS uses a quarterly, random-digit-dialed cellular and landline telephone number, followed by a mail survey of the children's vaccination providers, to collect provider-confirmed vaccination information. Data are weighted to be representative of the population of children 19-35 months of age, and are adjusted for multiple phone lines, mixed telephone lines (i.e., landline and cellular), household nonresponse, and the exclusion of phoneless households. There is another survey, called the 
			<a title="NIS-Teen"
			href="#NIS-Teen">NIS-Teen</a>, which assesses immunization levels among teens 13-17 years of age.
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px;">The NIS provides national and state estimates of vaccination coverage, including new vaccines as they are licensed and recommended for use. The survey also tracks progress towards 
			<a title="Healthy People 2020 goals"  href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/immunization-and-infectious-diseases/objectives">Healthy People 2020 goals</a>. The 2014 NIS is a measure of the effectiveness of strategies and activities that were in place up to three years ago.

		<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Survey Sample</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:40px;">The survey assessed the immunization histories of approximately 15,000 children in the United States, aged 19 through 35 months with provider-reported vaccination records. These children were born January 2011 through May 2013.</p>

		<a id="NIS-Definition"  title="NewBookmark"  data-ektron-placeholder="bookmark"></a>
		<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Definition of Coverage</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:40px;">As in 2013, the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series was reported which includes the full Hib vaccine. The 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series is an overall measure that encompasses many vaccines that are recommended for children.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px;">The 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series includes the following vaccines:</p>
		<ul style="margin-left:60px;">
			<li>4 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP);</li>
			<li>3 doses of Polio;</li>
			<li>1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR);</li>
			<li>3 or 4 doses of Hib depending on the product;</li>
			<li>3 doses of hepatitis B;</li>
			<li>1 dose of varicella; and</li>
			<li>4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)</li>
		</ul>
		<p style="margin-left:40px;">The 2014 NIS also focuses on the more recently recommended vaccines (i.e., hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, hepatitis A vaccine, PCV, and rotavirus vaccine) for children aged 19-35 months.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">About the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen)</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:40px">The NIS-Teen is a national survey conducted annually by the CDC to assess immunization levels for adolescents 13-17 years of age. This study collects data by interviewing households in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and selected areas for oversampling. The interviews are conducted by telephone, with households selected at random. To ensure the accuracy and precision of the vaccination coverage estimates, immunization data for surveyed adolescents are also collected through a mail survey of their pediatricians, family physicians, and other health care providers. The parents and guardians of eligible adolescents are asked during the telephone interview for consent to contact the adolescents’ vaccination providers. Types of immunizations, dates of administration, and additional data about facility characteristics are requested from immunization providers that are identified during the telephone survey of households. The NIS-Teen’s estimates of adolescent vaccination coverage reflect a comparison of information provided by both surveyed households and immunization providers. There is another survey, called the NIS, that assesses immunization levels among children 19-35 months of age.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px">The NIS-Teen was established to provide an on-going, consistent data set for analyzing vaccination levels among adolescents in the United States (US) and to disseminate this information to interested public health partners. The NIS-Teen provides national and state estimates of vaccination coverage, including new vaccines as they are licensed and recommended for use. It also helps track progress towards the

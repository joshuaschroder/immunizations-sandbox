<h2>Obtaining Records from Your Healthcare Provider</h2>
<p>If you need proof of immunization, the best place to start is by contacting the clinic, doctor, or healthcare provider that administered the vaccination. If your provider has the record on file, <em>this will be the fastest way of obtaining your records</em>.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>ImmTrac Registry</h2>
<p>If you are unable to obtain the records from your healthcare provider, your records may be stored in ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry.</p>
<p>ImmTrac began collecting immunization records in 1999 as an "opt-in" system for children only. Any records before 1999 would need to have been explicitly submitted for inclusion by a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Only doctors, schools, child-care centers, public health-care providers, and other authorized organizations may directly access ImmTrac. Immunization records are NOT available to view online by parents or legal guardians.</p>

<br/>
<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Child Immunization Records (0-17 years)</h3>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">There is a strong possibility that ImmTrac may have immunization records for vaccines administered to children under 18 years of age in Texas from 2005 to present. Since 2005, Texas law has required that all healthcare providers report to ImmTrac all vaccines administered to children younger than 18 years of age.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Adult Immunization Records (18+ years)</h3>

<p style="margin-left:40px;">ImmTrac began storing adult immunization records in 2009 as an "opt-in" registry system, allowing Texans age 18 years or older to voluntarily store their adult immunization records in the registry.</p> 
	
<p style="margin-left:40px;">Beginning in 2015, ImmTrac extended the timeframe to maintain childhood immunization records after an individual becomes an adult, from 18 to 26 years of age. Immunization records are automatically removed if a person does not complete and submit an ImmTrac Adult Consent Form by their 26th birthday.</p>

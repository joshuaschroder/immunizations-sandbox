<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Provisional Enrollment</h3>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">Notwithstanding the other requirements in this section, a student may be provisionally enrolled in these courses if the student has received at least one dose of each specified vaccine prior to enrollment and goes on to complete each vaccination series on schedule in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule as approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Physicians.

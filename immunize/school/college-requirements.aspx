<h2>Requirements for Healthcare and Veterinary Students</h2>
<p>Special immunization requirements exist for medical and veterinary students whose coursework may expose them to higher risk of potential exposure to viruses and bacteria. For a complete listing of requirements, please see the <a title="Requirements for Students Enrolled in Healthcare or Veterinary Coursework" href="/immunize/school/healthcare-veterinary.aspx"> Requirements for Students Enrolled in Healthcare or Veterinary Coursework</a> page.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Proof of Vaccination</h2>
<p>Students may show proof of vaccination against meningococcal disease by providing their college or university with an immunization record that shows they have been vaccinated against meningococcal disease in the last five years. Acceptable proof includes one of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A form showing the signature or stamp of a physician or his/her designee, or public health personnel that shows the month, day, and year the vaccination dose or booster was administered</li>
	<li>An official immunization record generated from a state or local health authority that shows the month, day, and year the vaccination or booster dose was administered</li>
	<li>An official record received from school officials (includes records from out of state)</li>
</ul>

<p>Students may get a copy of their immunization records from their private healthcare provider or local health department, depending on where the vaccination(s) were administered. If the student's immunization records are in <a title="ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry" href="http://www.immtracforeveryone.com">ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry</a>, he or she can request a copy by calling the Texas Immunization Information Line at 1-800-252-9152. Please note that individuals 18-26 years of age must re-consent as an adult in order to stay in the registry.</p>

<h2>Texas Pre-College Vaccination Requirements</h2>
<p>The Department of State Health Services (DSHS) requires all students attending 7th through 12th grades to have meningococcal vaccination, or show valid proof of exemption. Consequently, with these school requirements, some students entering institutions of higher education may already satisfy college entry requirements if they were vaccinated within the past five years. However, many students entering institutions of higher education will need to receive a booster dose of meningococcal vaccine at least ten days before the first day of class. Students should check their immunization records to see if they will need a dose of meningococcal vaccine.</p>

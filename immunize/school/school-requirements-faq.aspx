<h2>Meningococcal</h2>

<br/>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Q: Most of my students' records only say "Meningococcal" or "Meningitis," not "MCV4." Are these students considered compliant?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">A: Students showing proof of meningococcal vaccine for the first time (i.e., new 7th grade students and out-of-state transfer students), must have an immunization record that clearly indicates one of the following: MCV4, MenACWY, Menveo, or Menactra. Students that have previously submitted proof of meningococcal vaccination may be considered compliant if the dose of meningococcal vaccine was administered on or after the 11th birthday.</p>

<br/>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Q: I have several 6th graders that will turn 11 years old this year. Will the meningococcal requirement apply to them as soon as they turn 11?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">A: No. The meningococcal vaccine requirement applies only to students entering grades 7 - 12, not students aged 11 or older entering other grades. For students enrolling in grades 7 - 12, one dose of MCV4 must be received on or after the 11th birthday.</p>

<br/>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Q: I have an incoming 7th grade student that will still be 10 years old when school starts. Is this student required to have one dose of MCV4 upon enrollment?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">A: No, the dose of MCV4 will become due when the student is recommended to receive the vaccine (i.e., on or after the 11th birthday). For reporting purposes, the student should be considered provisionally enrolled until the student turns 11.</p>

<br/>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Q: A student received the adolescent dose of MCV4 at 9 years of age. Is the student in compliance?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">A: Doses administered prior to the 10th birthday will not satisfy this requirement.</p>

<br/>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Q: A student has only received Meningococcal B (MenB) vaccine. Will this satisfy the requirements?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">A: No, students must receive one dose quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) vaccine on or after the 11th birthday to be considered compliant.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR)</h2>

<br/>
<p style="margin-left:20px;"><strong>Q: Some of my older students received two doses of measles and one dose each of mumps and rubella, which satisfied the old school entry requirements. Will these students need to receive additional doses of MMR?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:40px;">A: Students that were vaccinated prior to 2009 with two doses of measles and one dose each of mumps and rubella should be considered compliant. All other students must show proof of two doses of MMR vaccine.</p>

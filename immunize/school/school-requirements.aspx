		<h2>Exemptions</h2>
		<p>Texas law allows (a) physicians to write medical exemption statements that the vaccine(s) required would be medically harmful or injurious to the health and well-being of the child or household member, and (b) parents/guardians to choose an exemption from immunization requirements for reasons of conscience, including a religious belief. The law does not allow parents/guardians to elect an exemption simply because of inconvenience (for example, a record is lost or incomplete and it is too much trouble to go to a physician or clinic to correct the problem). Schools should maintain an up-to-date list of students with exemptions, so they may be excluded in times of emergency or epidemic declared by the commissioner of public health.</p>
		
		<p><strong><em>Instructions for requesting the official exemption affidavit that must be signed by parents/guardians choosing the exemption for reasons of conscience, including a religious belief, can be found on the <a title="Exemption Information" href="/immunize/school/exemptions.aspx">Exemption Information</a> page of this website. Original Exemption Affidavit must be completed and submitted to the school.</em></strong></p>
		
		<p>For children claiming medical exemptions, a written statement by the physician must be submitted to the school. Unless it is written in the statement that a lifelong condition exists, the exemption statement is valid for only one year from the date signed by the physician.</p>

		<hr/>
		<h2>Provisional Enrollment</h2>
		<p>All immunizations should be completed by the first date of attendance. The law requires that students be fully vaccinated against the specified diseases. A student may be enrolled provisionally if the student has an immunization record that indicates the student has received at least one dose of each specified age-appropriate vaccine required by this rule. To remain enrolled, the student must complete the required subsequent doses in each vaccine series on schedule and as rapidly as is medically feasible and provide acceptable evidence of vaccination to the school. A school nurse or school administrator shall review the immunization status of a provisionally enrolled student every 30 days to ensure continued compliance in completing the required doses of vaccination. If, at the end of the 30-day period, a student has not received a subsequent dose of vaccine, the student is not in compliance and the school shall exclude the student from school attendance until the required dose is administered.</p>
		<p>Additional guidelines for provisional enrollment of students transferring from one Texas public or private school to another, students who are dependents of active duty military, students in foster care, and students who are homeless can be found in the TAC, Title 25 Health Services, Sections <a title="Title 25, Texas Administrative Code, Section 97.66" href="http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&app=9&p_dir=&p_rloc=&p_tloc=&p_ploc=&pg=1&p_tac=&ti=25&pt=1&ch=97&rl=66">97.66</a> and <a title="Title 25, Texas Administrative Code, Section 97.69" href="http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=T&app=9&p_dir=N&p_rloc=139984&p_tloc=&p_ploc=1&pg=4&p_tac=&ti=25&pt=1&ch=97&rl=66">97.69</a>.</p>

		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<p>Since many types of personal immunization records are in use, any document will be acceptable provided a physician or public health personnel has validated it. The month, day, and year that the vaccination was received must be recorded on all school immunization records created or updated after September 1, 1991.</p>

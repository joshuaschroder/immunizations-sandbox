		<h3>Provider Vaccine Choice</h3>
		
		<p>The TVFC Program supplies all <a title="ACIP recommended vaccines/toxoids" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/">ACIP recommended vaccines/toxoids</a> to enrolled providers.  Providers participating in the TVFC Program are required to offer all ACIP recommended vaccines to the eligible populations they serve, including influenza vaccine. <a title="House Bill 448 from the 81st Texas Legislature" href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/HB00448F.htm">House Bill 448 from the 81st Texas Legislature</a> gives TVFC and Adult Safety Net (ASN) providers the opportunity to choose their preferred brands and presentations of vaccines from their available formularies.</p>
		
		<p>The provider who signs the <a title="VFC Program Provider Agreement" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">VFC Program Provider Agreement</a> can choose vaccine brands and presentations.  The responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) will create the initial <a title="Biological Order Form (EC-68)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Biological Order Form (EC-68)</a> for new TVFC providers.  The initial Biological Order Form will reflect the provider choices, maximum stock levels (MSL), tiered ordering frequency (TOF), and order quantity.</p>
		
		<p>Each quarter, TVFC providers will have the opportunity to choose the brand and presentation for each TVFC vaccine in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system and can change or adjust specific vaccine brands, presentations, and percentages within each vaccine "family" (i.e., DTaP), or take no action to maintain the current selections.  A provider’s TVFC vaccine coordinator may complete the process, however, the provider who signed the VFC Program Provider Agreement must be consulted with and agree to the vaccine choices.  The vaccine choices, as well as the person making the changes, are captured electronically in EVI.  The TVFC providers are notified prior to the opening and closing of the vaccine choice period.</p>
		
		<p>Only vaccines supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the TVFC Program will be available for vaccine choice.</p>
		
		<p>In the event that a chosen vaccine is not available, the TVFC Program has the authority to replace the chosen vaccine with a comparable substitution until the chosen vaccine becomes available.  Vaccine choices do not apply in the event of a disaster or public health emergency, terrorist attack, hostile military or paramilitary actions, or an extraordinary law enforcement emergency.</p>

		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="MSL" name="MSL"></a>
		<h3>Vaccine Inventory Plan and Maximum Stock Levels (MSL)</h3>
		
		<p>The vaccine inventory plan requires all enrolled providers to maintain a monthly (60 day supply) of vaccine inventory.  CDC recommends that providers place orders when they have a four week supply of vaccine available, to ensure there is enough vaccine in stock to allow for any potential delays.  The CDC recommends smaller, more frequent orders rather than larger orders to minimize the amount of vaccine loss if an incident occurs during shipment or in the vaccine storage unit.  The 60 day supply of vaccine also allows providers 30 days of vaccine inventory when providers place their next vaccine order.  All providers are placed on a monthly ordering frequency.  Providers are not required to order each month, but as needed to maintain a 60 day supply of vaccine.</p>
		
		<p>The maximum stock level (MSL) is a calculated peak dose inventory (per vaccine type) and is the standard number of doses a TVFC provider can order on each month to maintain the 60 day inventory.  Special circumstances may allow for monthly MSL adjustments on rare occasions.  The provider must request review and permission from their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) prior to ordering outside of their MSL.</p>
		
		<p>Upon initial enrollment, the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) will work with the TVFC provider to develop MSLs based on the provider’s patient population.  All MSLs are monitored and revised in EVI.  Newly enrolled providers may have their MSL reassessed by their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) after 3 months with the TVFC Program.</p>
		
		<p>MSLs are recalculated twice a year based upon doses administered data.  A monthly average MSL is determined from this data.  Providers may not order vaccine in excess of their suggested quantity.  Providers may place a second vaccine order within a given month, as long as all required reporting has been submitted, as detailed in subsection F. Vaccine Ordering in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory System, and they are not exceeding their MSL.</p>
		
		<p>See the <a title="TVFC Reporting Requirements page" href="/immunize/tvfc/reporting-requirements.aspx">TVFC Reporting Requirements page</a>, for more detail of the monthly reporting requirements.</p>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Increasing-Decreasing-MSLs">
		<hr/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="IncDecMSL" name="IncDecMSL"></a>
		<h3>Increasing and Decreasing Maximum Stock Levels</h3>

		<p>A provider’s MSL may be increased or decreased at any time if the number of TVFC-eligible children served changes, or if there are any applicable changes to the status of the facility that might impact vaccine usage.  TVFC providers can notify their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) if they feel a change is needed.  Changes may also be made by the DSHS Immunization Unit based upon the data gathered during the calendar year.</p>
		
		<p>To determine appropriate MSLs for the Back to School season, calculations will be done by the DSHS Immunization Unit to determine the new MSL utilizing the reporting data from the previous calendar year.</p>
		
		<p>Providers that consistently order below their suggested quantity may have their MSL lowered. Providers that place multiple orders during a given month, may have their MSL increased.  Final determination is made depending on the frequency and duration of the provider’s ordering pattern.</p>

	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Short-Dated-Vaccine">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="short-dated-vaccine" name="short-dated-vaccine"></a>
		<h3>Short-Dated Vaccine</h3>
		
		<p>Short-dated vaccines are those vaccines that are within 90 days of expiration.  Placing orders according to the established MSLs and rotating vaccines so that short-dated vaccines are used first will help to prevent losses due to expiration.  Vaccine surplus kept in inventory increases the risk of vaccine expiration and increases the amount of loss in the event of refrigerator failure.  When ordering vaccines, TVFC providers must keep no more than the designated MSL.  Clinic staff must note vaccine expiration dates when physically counting inventory at the end of the month.  Short-dated vaccine must be used first.</p>
		
		<p>Each TVFC provider is required to notify their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) 90 days prior to the expiration of vaccine.  If the provider is unable to administer the vaccine prior to expiration, the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) will assist with re-distribution of the vaccine and move it accordingly, if accepted at another provider and move it accordingly, if accepted at another provider.  Short-dated vaccines that are released to the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) for transfer do not need to be reported on the Vaccine Transfer Authorization.</p>
		
		<p>Diluents must be managed in the same manner as vaccines; the expiration date of diluents must be checked prior to every reconstitution.  The TVFC providers must also rotate diluent stock to use the shortest expiration date first.</p>
		
		<p>If vaccines are allowed to expire, they are considered non-viable and must be placed in a Vaccine Quarantine Bag clearly labeled "Do not use" and must be removed from storage units.</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="StorageCapacity">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="storage-capacity" name="storage-capacity"></a>
		<h3>Storage Capacity</h3>
		
		<p>A TVFC provider must have adequate refrigeration and/or freezer space to accommodate a maximum order based on their MSL. A TVFC provider must also take into consideration the space needed for their private stock when calculating storage capacity.  Storage units must be approved and monitored according to this chapter.</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Electronic-Vaccine-Inventory">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="EVI" name="EVI"></a>
		<h3>Vaccine Ordering in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) System</h3>
		
		<p>The TVFC Program uses the EVI system for vaccine ordering.  EVI allows TVFC providers to manage their vaccine inventory online.  All vaccine orders will be placed in EVI unless internet access is unavailable.  A TVFC provider may be held responsible for vaccine loss that is a result of erroneous information entered into EVI.</p>
		
		<p>Prior to placing an order, TVFC providers are required to enter the following information into EVI:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Verification of days and hours of operation (to receive vaccine) and the delivery address</li>
			<li>Primary and back-up point of contact information</li>
			<li>All vaccine received</li>
			<li>All doses transferred</li>
			<li>Any expired, spoiled, or wasted vaccine</li>
			<li>All doses administered within the last calendar month</li>
			<li>A physical count of all vaccines by brand, presentation, lot number, and expiration date  within two days of placing their online order (EC-33 report)</li>
			<li>All doses that will expire within 90 days, if applicable</li>
			<li>Any scheduled clinic closures (including holidays) must be noted in the comments section of the order
			<li>Providers must also submit the following reports to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) via fax or a scanned copy:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Temperature logs (EC-105)</li>
					<li>Borrowing form (EF11-14171), if applicable</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>All of this reporting is required for all TVFC vaccines each month whether an order is placed, or not.</p>
		
		<p>All orders placed in EVI will be reviewed and approved by the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) pending the TVFC provider’s completion and submission of the required monthly reporting and resolution of any outstanding issues.  Incomplete or inaccurate online orders will be placed on "Hold" pending corrections by the TVFC provider which may cause orders to be delayed.</p>
		
		<p>Each TVFC provider must abide by their established MSLs when ordering vaccine.  EVI uses the TVFC provider’s MSLs and current inventory to determine a suggested quantity of vaccine on the "Place Order" tab.  Any orders exceeding the MSL will be reviewed on a case by case basis.</p>
		
		<p>Vaccine loss is captured electronically in EVI.  When a TVFC provider documents, as required, any expired, spoiled, or wasted vaccine in EVI, the system will automatically place subsequent orders on "Hold" until the nature of the loss has been determined.</p>
		
		<p>All TVFC providers are able to view their order status on the "Order History" page of EVI.  Status definitions are the following:</p>
		
		<h4>EVI Order Status Descriptions</h4>
		<table class="zebraBorder layout" summary="table not sorted" style="width:100%;">

		<p>If any discrepancy is found between the orders placed, the packing list, the fax confirmation, or the doses received, TVFC providers are instructed to immediately contact their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) for resolution.  All vaccines should be appropriately stored immediately upon receipt regardless of any errors in the order.</p>

		<a class="bookmark" title="no-internet" name="no-internet"></a>
		<h3>Vaccine Ordering for Providers without Internet Access</h3>
		
		<p>A TVFC provider without access to the internet will contact their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD), who will then enter the TVFC provider’s order online.  The TVFC provider will submit the following paper forms to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) so that their vaccine order can be placed:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a title="Monthly Biological Report" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Monthly Biological Report (C-33)</a></li>
			<li><a title="Biological Order Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Biological Order Form (C-68)</a></li>
			<li><a title="Temperature Recording Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The Monthly Biological Report is reviewed by their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) to ensure that the beginning inventory matches the last month’s ending inventory.  Calculations must be correct and the net loss or gain must not exceed five doses of any one vaccine.  Any corrections needed are reported to the TVFC provider so the records can be corrected prior to ordering.</p>

		<h3>Vaccine Ordering for Newly Enrolled TVFC Providers</h3>
		
		<p>Newly enrolled TVFC providers are set up for vaccine ordering in EVI during New Provider Training with their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).  The order is placed by the TVFC provider as part of the training.  The responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) collects and reviews the following paper reports prior to placing the new TVFC provider’s vaccine order:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a title="Biological Order Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Biological Order Form (C-68)</a></li>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Influenza-Vaccine">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="influenza" name="influenza"></a>
		<h3>Ordering Influenza Vaccine</h3>

		<p>ACIP recommends routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged 6 months and older.  Additionally, as a provider for the TVFC Program, you have agreed to administer all ACIP recommended vaccines to the eligible population that you serve.</p>
		
		<p>The pre-book is a commitment by the TVFC provider to order doses for the upcoming flu season.  Annual influenza vaccine orders are typically pre-booked by TVFC providers in the first quarter of each calendar year.  TVFC providers will use an online survey tool to select their vaccine choices for the upcoming season.  The link to the survey is released to the TVFC providers in a memo with a brief description of the influenza vaccines available for the upcoming flu season.</p>
		
		<p>If the orders exceed the expected number of eligible children from the TVFC provider profile, providers are contacted for an explanation.  If a TVFC provider who sees TVFC-eligible children does not order influenza vaccine for the upcoming season, they must complete a separate section of the survey explaining why they are not ordering the vaccine.  A TVFC provider is required to follow all ACIP recommendations, including the administration of influenza vaccine.  A TVFC provider who does not order influenza vaccine will receive a follow-up phone call from their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) or the TVFC Program.</p>
		
		<p>The TVFC Program orders a limited quantity of additional doses to account for new TVFC providers who enroll after the closing of the pre-book survey.  Other unforeseen situations that may occur between the pre-book and the actual release of the vaccines to the TVFC Program may also be considered for first round allocation.</p>
		
		<p>Influenza vaccine will be allocated to TVFC providers as it is made available to Texas.  The TVFC Program typically completes all pre-booked and new TVFC provider orders first as part of the first round allocation.  A second influenza survey tool will be re-opened for TVFC providers that did not order during the pre-book period and for those TVFC providers who wish to add to their original order.  When the first and second round orders are filled entirely, any remaining influenza vaccine will be added to the EVI system for general ordering by all TVFC providers.  If there is an additional need for influenza vaccine, the TVFC Program will contact other TVFC providers in Texas for a possible vaccine transfer or place an additional order with the CDC.</p>
		
		<p>The TVFC Program recognizes that both TVFC supplied and privately-purchased influenza vaccines may arrive at a TVFC provider's office at different times during the influenza season.  Even if this occurs, the TVFC Program does not allow TVFC providers to borrow TVFC influenza doses and administer them to their non-TVFC-eligible clients.</p>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Mass-Vaccination-Clinics">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="mass-vaccination" name="mass-vaccination"></a>
		<h3>Vaccine Ordering for Mass Vaccination Clinics</h3>

		<p>A TVFC provider who participates in mass vaccination clinics must have the TVFC vaccine delivered directly to the clinic locations.  The total time for transport and the workday should not exceed 8 hours.  Routine transport of vaccine is not recommended due to the risk of compromising the cold chain and vaccine viability.  However, because most temporary mass clinics typically require vaccine transport on the day of the clinic, these temporary clinics (e.g., school located clinic) require enhanced storage and handling practices.  The TVFC provider must develop mass vaccination protocols to ensure that outreach efforts meet all TVFC requirements.  The protocol must include information showing how the TVFC provider has established vaccine needs (provider profile) and a plan for overseeing vaccine ordering for each clinic site to ensure that proper amounts of TVFC stock are transported on each clinic day.  The plan should include the type of portable storage unit being used, how the cold chain will be maintained from the beginning to the end of the mass vaccination clinic, and each site location should be documented on the <a title="Temperature Recording Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)</a>.  The TVFC provider’s responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) must review and approve mass vaccination plan prior to initiation of the mass vaccination clinics.</p>
		
		<p>Specific storage and handling requirements for mass vaccination clinics is discussed on the <a title="vaccine storage and handling page" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx">vaccine storage and handling page</a>.</p>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Vaccine-Distributors">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="distributors" name="distributors"></a>
		<h3>Vaccine Distributors</h3>
		<p>The TVFC Program uses two vaccine distribution centers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>McKesson Specialty, a third party distributor which ships the majority of TVFC vaccines</li>
			<li>Merck, the manufacturer of varicella vaccines, which ships directly to providers</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Receiving-Vaccine-Orders">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="receiving" name="receiving"></a>
		<h3>Receiving Vaccine Orders</h3>

		<p>The TVFC Program requires that TVFC providers always accept vaccine shipments and never refuse or return the shipments without specific instructions from the TVFC Program or from their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).  The TVFC provider must ensure that the accurate clinic address and delivery hours are entered into EVI.</p>
		
		<p>In order for TVFC providers to receive vaccine shipments, appropriate staff must be on site and available at least one day a week other than Monday and for at least four consecutive hours that day.  Each TVFC provider establishes the hours available to accept vaccine shipments when they submit their initial vaccine order in EVI.  The vaccine will be shipped so that it will arrive when the provider is available to accept the order.  The TVFC provider will not be able to change their available hours in EVI once an order is placed.  The TVFC provider will be held responsible for incomplete or erroneous information entered into EVI which can result in vaccine loss.</p>
		
		<p>The TVFC provider can expect their approved orders approximately one to three weeks after placing their online order in EVI.  It is important to recognize and store vaccine shipments immediately to ensure vaccine viability.</p>
		
		<p>All TVFC providers are required to train their staff on what a vaccine shipment looks like.  All TVFC providers must have a protocol in place to ensure the vaccine gets stored quickly and appropriately upon arrival.</p>
		
		<p>The following steps are required when a vaccine shipment arrives:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Check actual vaccines received against packing list to verify all vaccines have been received</li>
			<li>Inspect the vaccines and check the temperature and monitor reading device</li>
			<li>Determine the length of time the vaccine was in transit by looking at the ship date and time on the packing list or the transport tracking link in EVI</li>
			<li>Ensure adequate amount of diluent is included for those vaccines which require reconstitution (i.e., MMR, varicella)</li>
			<li>Immediately contact the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) if the appropriate quantity and type of vaccine or diluent is not received</li>
			<li>Call the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) immediately upon receipt of vaccines that have been received in error</li>
			<li>If vaccines appear to be compromised, contact the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) immediately</li>
			<li>Appropriately store all vaccines immediately upon receipt regardless of errors (i.e., quantity, shipping, and transport)</li>
			<li>Check expiration dates and rotate stock to ensure short-dated vaccines are used first</li>
			<li>Immediately enter receipt of the vaccines in EVI</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Each package shipped from McKesson comes with a temperature monitoring strip(s).  If the monitor strip(s) indicates, or if staff suspects that the cold chain has been compromised, staff must immediately follow the instructions in subsection D below, "Vaccines Received Warm or Questionable."</p>
	
	<p>All TVFC providers are required to record the vaccine at the time of receipt in EVI to maintain correct online vaccine inventory.</p>

</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Maintenance-of-Cold-Chain">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="cold-chain" name="cold-chain"></a>
		<h3>Manufacturer and Distributor Maintenance of the Cold Chain</h3>
		
		<p>The manufacturer and distributor pack the vaccine using qualified pack-outs and containers that have been tested to maintain appropriate temperatures.  Refrigerated vaccine is packed to maintain the cold chain for 72 hours.  The vaccine will be shipped using high quality cardboard boxes with Styrofoam inserts.</p>
		
		<p>Packages are imprinted with "Temperature Sensitive Product" and include red stickers reading "Refrigerate upon Arrival" to alert clinic staff to refrigerate contents immediately upon arrival.</p>
		
		<p>Varicella products are directly shipped from Merck.  Merck products are shipped frozen with a four-day pack-out.  If the vaccine arrives within four days of the pack date on the invoice, then the vaccine is viable.  The TVFC provider must immediately store the Varicella vaccine in proper storage.</p>
		
		<p>If the vaccine arrives outside of the four-day pack-out, then the TVFC provider must immediately place the vaccine in a Vaccine Quarantine Bag provided by the TVFC Program, store the vaccine properly, notify their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD), and contact the manufacturer.</p>

		<p>Replacement instructions will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
		
		<p>Merck has implemented a cooler recycling program for direct ship products.  A prepaid United Parcel Service (UPS) shipping label is included with each container.  Once the vaccine is removed and the container is empty, the provider must seal the container and affix the prepaid UPS shipping label.</p>
		
		<p>The TVFC provider will have to wait until UPS returns to their office with the next delivery to return the cooler.  If the TVFC provider calls UPS to schedule a pick-up, the provider will be charged a pick-up fee.</p>

		<a class="bookmark" title="received-warm" name="received-warm"></a>
		<h3>Vaccines Received Warm or Questionable</h3>
		
		<p>Vaccines must always be stored properly, even if viability is questionable.  If vaccines are received warm, damaged, or otherwise questionable, the TVFC provider needs to immediately contact their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).  Questionable vaccine must be placed in a Vaccine Quarantine Bag provided by the TVFC Program and segregated in proper storage until viability can be determined.</p>
		
		<p>Examples of potentially non-viable vaccines:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>Vaccine shipment received with temperature indicator strip showing out of range</li>
			<li>Vaccine is warm to touch</li>
			<li>Vaccine is received damaged</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If vaccine viability is questionable upon receipt, follow these instructions:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Segregate questionable vaccine in a Vaccine Quarantine Bag, provided by the TVFC Program, and place questionable vaccines in the refrigerator or freezer, as applicable, until viability can be determined.  Do not write on the vaccine itself.</li>
			<li>Contact the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) to inform them of the determination of the viability of the vaccine.</li>
			<li>Contact the manufacturer immediately to determine the viability of the vaccine.  If the manufacturer is unable to respond, the provider must inform the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) to refer the situation to the Immunization Unit Nurse Consultant or the DSHS pharmacist.</li>
			<li>It is critical to contact the customer service center for centralized distribution on the same day the vaccine arrived at the TVFC provider’s office as documented by the carrier.  Any calls received after the day of delivery will result in the CDC’s liability for vaccine replacement, regardless of the cause of the temperature excursion.  This documentation must be maintained with the provider’s TVFC records for a minimum of five years.</li>
			<li>All TVFC providers must keep the vaccine quarantined and wait for the instructions for replacement, reporting loss, etc. from their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Note: </strong>Vaccine returns due to shipping issues are required to be returned to McKesson within 48 hours.  Merck requires that the request for replacement be received within 15 days of the original shipment.</p>

		<h3>Vaccines Received in Error</h3>
		
		<p>TVFC providers must call their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) immediately upon receipt of vaccines that are received in error.  The TVFC provider may opt to keep the vaccine if they have storage capacity and can administer the doses.  If the TVFC provider cannot absorb the vaccine into their stock, then their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) will assist in redistributing the vaccine to other TVFC providers to prevent vaccine wastage.</p>

		<h3>Provider Vaccine Choice</h3>
		<p>The TVFC Program supplies all <a title="ACIP recommended vaccines/toxoids" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/">ACIP recommended vaccines/toxoids</a> to enrolled providers. Providers participating in the TVFC Program are required to offer all ACIP recommended vaccines to the eligible populations they serve, including influenza. <a title="House Bill 448 from the 81st Texas Legislature" href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/HB00448F.htm">House Bill 448 from the 81st Texas Legislature</a> gives TVFC and Adult Safety Net (ASN) providers the opportunity to choose their preferred brands and presentations of vaccines.</p>
		<p>The medical provider who signs the <a title="VFC Program Provider Agreement" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">VFC Program Provider Agreement</a> can either choose vaccine brands and presentations, or be consulted with and agree to the choices made for the clinic. The DSHS health service region or local health department will create the initial <a title="Biological Order Form (EC-68)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Biological Order Form (EC-68)</a> for new TVFC providers. The initial Biological Order Form will reflect the provider choices, maximum stock levels (MSL), tiered ordering frequency (TOF), and order quantity.</p>
		<p>Vaccine choices will remain in effect until the vaccine choice optional update is opened. Each quarter, providers will have the opportunity to choose the brand and presentation for each TVFC vaccine in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system and can change/adjust specific vaccine brands, presentations, and percentages within each vaccine "family" (i.e. DTaP) or take no action to maintain the current selections. A representative for the provider may complete the process; however, the provider who signed the TVFC Provider Agreement must be consulted with and agree to the vaccine choices. The vaccine choices, as well as the person making changes, are captured electronically in EVI. Providers are notified prior to the opening and closing of the vaccine choice period.</p>
		<p>Only vaccines supplied to DSHS through contracts with the CDC will be available for choice. Vaccines exceeding 115% of the lowest-priced equivalent vaccine may not be available.</p>
		<p>In the event any vaccine chosen is not available, DSHS has the authority to replace the chosen vaccine with a comparable substitution until the chosen vaccine becomes available. Vaccine choices do not apply in the event of a disaster or public health emergency, terrorist attack, hostile military or paramilitary actions, or an extraordinary law enforcement emergency.</p>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Maximun-Stock-Levels">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="MSL" name="MSL"></a>
		<h3>Maximum Stock Levels (MSL)</h3>
		<p>Maximum Stock Level calculated peak dose inventory (per vaccine type). The standard number of doses a provider should order up to on each regularly scheduled vaccine order.</p>
		<p>DSHS HSRs and LHDs will work with the provider to develop MSLs. MSLs are monitored, calculated, and revised in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system. Online MSL adjustment will include a variable MSL based on season and an adjustment for upward or downward administration trends.</p>
		<p>MSLs are calculated manually using the following process:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Obtain an average of the doses administered for each vaccine, excluding any month's data that could skew the result. The average can be based on any number of months as long as they are reflective of current usage.</li>
			<li>Multiply the average obtained in Step 1 by 2.5 for a monthly provider, 3.5 for a bi-monthly provider, or 4.5 for a quarterly provider.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The number obtained in Step 2 is the MSL for the provider.</p>
		<p>MSLs are based upon a 45-day base of vaccine to allow for potential distribution delays, plus vaccine for the number of days between orders. See table below:</p>

		<a class="bookmark" title="TOF" name="TOF"></a>
		<h3>Tiered Ordering Frequency (TOF)</h3>
		<p>Tiered Ordering Frequency: The period of time between scheduled vaccine orders. There are three typical TOFs: monthly, bi-monthly, and quarterly.</p>
		<p>DSHS HSRs and LHDs will determine a provider's TOF upon enrollment along with the MSL. The TOF is based upon actual or projected annual vaccines usage and provider storage capacity. Providers will be scheduled to place vaccine orders:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Monthly</strong> - Once a month if more than 6,000 doses are ordered per year</li>
			<li><strong>Bi-Monthly</strong> - Once every other month if between 800 - 6,000 doses are ordered per year</li>
			<li><strong>Quarterly</strong> - Every three months if between 200 - 799 doses are ordered per year</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Large providers will order more frequently, while smaller providers will order less often.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="StorageCapacity">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="storage-capacity" name="storage-capacity"></a>
		<h3>Storage Capacity</h3>
	<p>A provider must have adequate refrigeration/freezer space to accommodate a maximum order based on TOF and MSL, as well as largest annual inventory. A <a title="Storage Calculation Tool and instructions" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-storage-resources">Storage Calculation Tool and instructions</a> are available on the TVFC website. Providers should take into consideration that additional space may be needed.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Electronic-Vaccine-Inventory">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="EVI" name="EVI"></a>
		<h3>Vaccine Ordering in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) System</h3>
		<p>EVI allows providers to manage their vaccine inventory online. All vaccine orders will be placed in EVI unless internet access is unavailable. Providers are required to enter into EVI all vaccine received, doses transferred, doses administered, expired/wasted vaccine and their physical count for all TVFC vaccines each month regardless of whether an order is placed. When a provider places an order in EVI, the system requires doses administered to be entered up to the current date and the current inventory to be dated within two days of placing an order.</p>
		<p>All orders will be reviewed and approved by the DSHS health service region or local health department pending the provider's completion and submission of the <a title="Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)</a> and resolution of any outstanding issues. Incomplete or inaccurate online orders will be placed on "Hold" by the system pending corrections by the provider which may cause orders to be delayed.</p>
		<p>Providers should abide by their established MSLs and TOFs when ordering vaccine. EVI uses the provider's MSLs and current inventory to determine a suggested quantity of vaccine on the "Place Order" tab. Providers are allowed to request quantities exceeding their MSL; however, a justification is required for each brand/presentation in the "Comment" section on the "Place Order" tab to validate the request.</p>
		<p>Vaccine loss is captured electronically in EVI. When a provider documents, as required, any expired, spoiled, or wasted vaccine on a Vaccine Loss Report in EVI, the system will automatically place subsequent orders on "Hold" until the nature of the loss has been determined (negligent or non-negligent).</p>
		<p>Providers are responsible for entering accurate provider information into EVI, including shipping address, days and hours available to receive vaccine shipments, and primary and back-up contact information. Providers may be held responsible for vaccine loss that is a result of erroneous information entered into EVI.</p>
		<p>Providers are able to view their order statuses on the "Order History" page of EVI:</p>

		<h3>Vaccine Ordering for Providers without Internet Access</h3>
		<p>TVFC providers without access to the internet will contact their responsible entity (DSHS, Health Service Region, or Local Health Department), who will then enter the provider's order online. Providers without internet access will submit the following paper reports to the responsible entity in order to place their vaccine order:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a title="Monthly Biological Report" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Monthly Biological Report (C-33)</a></li>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Influenza-Vaccine">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="influenza" name="influenza"></a>
		<h3>Ordering Influenza Vaccine</h3>
		<p>Annual influenza vaccine orders are typically pre-booked by TVFC providers between February and March each year. The pre-book is a commitment by the provider to order doses for the upcoming season. Providers will use an online survey tool to select their vaccine choices for the upcoming season. The link to the survey is released to the TVFC providers in a memo with a brief description of the influenza vaccines available for the upcoming season.</p>
		<p>If the orders are outside the expected number of eligible children from the provider profile, providers are contacted for an explanation. If a TVFC provider who sees TVFC-eligible children does not order flu vaccines for the upcoming season, they must complete a separate section of the survey explaining why they are not ordering flu vaccine. TVFC providers are expected to follow all ACIP recommendations, including the administration of influenza vaccine. Providers who do not order influenza vaccine will receive a follow-up phone call from the DSHS health service region or the TVFC Program. </p>
		<p>The Immunizations Unit orders a limited quantity of additional doses to account for new providers who enroll after the closing of the pre-book survey. Other unforeseen situations that may occur between the pre-book and the actual release of the doses to the state may also be considered for first round allocation. </p>
		<p>Influenza vaccine will be allocated to providers as influenza vaccine is made available to Texas. The DSHS Immunizations Unit typically completes all pre-booked and new provider orders first. A second influenza survey tool will be re-opened for providers that did not order during the pre-book period and for those providers who wish to add to their original order. When first round and second round orders are entirely filled, any remaining influenza vaccines will be added to the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system for general ordering by all providers. If there is an additional need for influenza vaccine, the Immunizations Unit will contact other providers in Texas for a possible vaccine transfer or place an additional order with the CDC.</p>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Vaccine-Distributors">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="distributors" name="distributors"></a>
		<h3>Vaccine Distributors</h3>
		<p>DSHS uses two vaccine distribution centers:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>McKesson Specialty, a third party distributor which ships the majority of TVFC vaccines</li>
			<li>Merck, the manufacturer of varicella-containing vaccines, which ships directly to providers</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Receiving-Vaccine-Orders">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="receiving" name="receiving"></a>
		<h3>Receiving Vaccine Orders</h3>
		<p>TVFC requires providers always accept vaccine shipments. Never refuse or return vaccine shipments without specific instructions from DSHS or your DSHS health service region or local health department. Providers must ensure that the accurate shipping address and delivery hours are entered into the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system.</p>
		<p>In order for providers to receive vaccine shipments, providers must be on site with appropriate staff available at least one day a week other than Monday, and for at least four consecutive hours that day. Providers will be held responsible for incomplete or erroneous information entered into EVI which results in vaccine loss.</p>
		<p>Providers can expect their approved orders approximately one to three weeks after placing their online order in EVI. It is important to recognize and store vaccine shipments immediately to ensure vaccine viability. Providers are required to train all staff on what a vaccine shipment looks like. TVFC requires all providers to have a protocol to ensure the vaccine gets stored quickly and appropriately upon arrival. The following steps should be taken when a vaccine shipment arrives:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Check actual vaccine received against packing list to verify all vaccines have been received.</li>
			<li>Verify the packing list against order placed in EVI to ensure all vaccines ordered were received.</li>
			<li>Ensure adequate diluent is included for vaccines requiring reconstitution (i.e., MMR, Hib, varicella).</li>
			<li>IMMEDIATELY contact the DSHS health service region or local health department if the appropriate vaccine (or diluent) is not received.</li>
			<li>Place vaccine in appropriate storage immediately.</li>
			<li>Make sure to check expiration dates and rotate stock to ensure short-dated vaccine is used first.</li>
			<li>Each package shipped from McKesson comes with a temperature monitoring strip(s). If the monitor strip indicates, or if staff suspects, that the cold chain has been compromised, staff should immediately contact their appropriate responsible entity (HSR or LHD). Follow the procedures below for "<a title="Vaccines Received Warm or Questionable" href="#received-warm">Vaccines Received Warm or Questionable</a>."</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Providers are required to record the receipt of vaccine in EVI at the time of receipt to maintain correct online vaccine inventory.</p>
		<p>Manufacturer and distributor pack vaccine using qualified pack-outs and containers that have been tested to maintain appropriate temperatures for a given length of time up to a maximum ambient temperature. Refrigerated vaccine is packed to maintain the cold chain for 72 hours (3 days). Vaccine will be shipped using high quality cardboard boxes with Styrofoam inserts. Packages are imprinted with 'Temperature Sensitive Product' and include red stickers reading 'Refrigerate upon Arrival' to alert clinic staff to refrigerate contents immediately upon arrival.</p>
		<p>Varicella-containing products are direct-shipped from Merck. Merck products are shipped frozen with a four day pack-out. If the vaccine arrives within four days of the pack date on the invoice, then the vaccine is viable. Providers should immediately store the varicella-containing vaccines in proper storage. If the vaccine arrives outside of the four day pack out, then the provider should immediately store the vaccine properly and contact the manufacturer. Replacement instructions will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
		<p>Merck has implemented a cooler recycling program for direct ship products. A prepaid UPS shipping label is included with each container. Once the vaccine is removed and the container is empty, the provider should seal the container and affix the prepaid UPS shipping label. Providers will have to wait until UPS returns to their office with the next delivery to return the cooler. If the provider calls UPS to schedule a pick-up, the provider will be charged a pick-up fee.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Vaccines-Received-Warm">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="received-warm" name="received-warm"></a>
		<h3>Vaccines Received Warm or Questionable</h3>
		<p>Vaccine must always be stored properly, even if viability is questionable. If vaccine is received warm, damaged, or otherwise questionable, the provider needs to immediately contact the DSHS health service region or local health department. Questionable vaccine should be labeled "Do Not Use" and segregated in proper storage until viability can be determined.</p>
		<p>Examples of potentially non-viable vaccines are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Vaccine shipment received with temperature indicator strip showing out of range</li>
			<li>Vaccine is warm to touch</li>
			<li>Vaccines are received damaged</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Instructions to follow if vaccine viability is questionable upon receipt:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Before storing the questionable vaccines in the refrigerator and/or freezer, place questionable vaccines in a bag labeled "Do Not Use" or attach a piece of paper with "Do Not Use" written in large letters. Do not write on the vaccine itself. Labeled vaccine must be stored in appropriate storage. Do not use questionable vaccine until further directions are received.</li>
			<li>Contact the DSHS Pharmacy or manufacturer immediately to determine the viability of the vaccine. If the provider contacts the manufacturer, the provider must receive documentation of the determination in writing. This documentation must be maintained the with the provider's TVFC records for a minimum of five years. Providers must contact their responsible entity to inform them of the determination of the viability of the vaccine. Providers should never contact the distributor unless instructed to do so by the DSHS health service region or local health department.</li>
			<li>Wait for the instructions for replacement, reporting loss, etc. from the DSHS health service region or local health department. DSHS health service region and local health department staff cannot make the determining factor on vaccine viability. The DSHS health service region or local health department will direct you to the appropriate contact for determination.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: Vaccine returns due to shipping issues are required to be returned to McKesson within 48 hours.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Vaccines-Received-in-Error">
		<br/>
		<a class="bookmark" title="error" name="error"></a>
		<h3>Vaccines Received in Error</h3>
		<p>TVFC providers must call their responsible entity (DSHS health service region or local health department) immediately upon receipt of vaccine(s) received in error. The provider may opt to keep the vaccine if they have storage capacity and can administer the doses. If the provider cannot absorb the vaccine into their stock, then the DSHS health service region or local health department will assist in redistributing vaccine to other TVFC providers to prevent vaccine wastage.</p>

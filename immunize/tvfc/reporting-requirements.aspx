		<h2>About Reporting Requirements</h2>
		<p>TVFC requires providers to monitor the temperatures of all refrigerators and freezers containing TVFC vaccine and to submit reports on DSHS forms documenting vaccine inventory and usage.</p>
		<p>All forms are available on the <a title="TVFC publications webpage" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">TVFC publications webpage</a>.</p>	
		<p>All records related to the TVFC Program are required to be maintained for five years. These records include (but are not limited to):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Monthly Biological Report (C-33-A)</li>
			<li>Biological Order Form (C-68)</li>
			<li>Temperature Recording Form (EC-105-xx series)
				<ul>
					<li>Refrigerator Fahrenheit (EC-105-RF)</li>
					<li>Refrigerator Celsius (EC-105-RC)</li>
					<li>Freezer Fahrenheit (EC-105-FF)</li>

		<h2>Reports Summary</h2>
		
		<div class="SubSection" id="Monthly-Biological">
			<a class="bookmark" title="C-33" name="C-33"></a>
			<br/>
			<h3>Monthly Biological Report (C-33-A)</h3>
			<p>The <a title="Monthly Biological Report" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Monthly Biological Report</a> is now documented in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system as vaccine received, doses administered, vaccine transferred, vaccine loss, and physical count. The Tally and Physical Count report in EVI may be used to help document vaccine management.</p>
			<p>Qualified providers who participate in the <a title="ASN Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/tvfc-asn.aspx">ASN Program</a> are required to distinguish between their adult and pediatric vaccines and order and report adult vaccines separately from TVFC pediatric vaccines. The <a title="Combined Tally and Inventory Sheet (C-88)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory ">Combined Tally and Inventory Sheet (C-88)</a> is an optional form that may assist in tracking pediatric doses versus adult doses administered.</p>
			<p>For those providers without internet access, the provider must complete the Monthly Biological Report and submit it to their responsible entity each month. The person completing the paper Monthly Biological Report should always sign and date the report and provide a telephone number where they can be reached. This is required in case discrepancies are identified on the report and a follow-up phone call is needed.		</p>

			<a class="bookmark" title="C-68" name="C-68"></a>
			<br/>
			<h3>Biological Order Form (C-68)</h3>
			<p>This form is only for initial orders or for those providers that do not have internet access. The <a title="Biological Order Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Biological Order Form (C-68)</a> documents the amount of vaccine the clinic will order. All vaccines should be ordered to bring the clinic up to their pre-determined MSL. For orders above the MSL, an explanation is required in the comment section.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="SubSection" id="Temperature-Recording">
			<a class="bookmark" title="EC-105" name="EC-105"></a>
			<br/>
			<h3>Temperature Recording Forms (EC-105-xx)</h3>
			<p>Completed <a title="Temperature Recording Forms (EC-105-xx)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Forms (EC-105-xx)</a> for the previous month are to be submitted to the DSHS health service region or local health department. A Temperature Recording Form is to be maintained on all refrigerators and freezers that store TVFC vaccine (including temporary day storage units). Providers may choose to use Fahrenheit (EC-105-RF and EC-105-FF) or Celsius (EC-105-RC and EC-105-FC) forms.</p>
			<p>TVFC vaccines are required to be maintained at proper storage temperatures at all times. To ensure proper temperatures are maintained, TVFC requires providers to record refrigerator and/or freezer temperatures twice daily for all units that store TVFC vaccine. Providers are also required to record min/max temperatures at least once daily, preferably in the morning. Results of each check must be documented on the Temperature Recording Form and the form must be initialed by the staff member conducting the check. Instructions for completing the Temperature Recording Form are listed on the top of the form.</p>
			<p>If an out-of-range temperature is observed, immediately contact the responsible entity (DSHS health service region or local health department) and complete the Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record attached to the Temperature Recording Form. Providers must include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Date and time of event</li>
				<li>Storage unit temperature</li>
				<li>Room temperature</li>
				<li>Name of person completing the report</li>
				<li>Description of the event</li>
				<li>Action taken (including the instructions and procedures given by the responsible entity and the individual with whom you spoke)</li>
				<li>Results</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All documentation regarding temperature deviations should be retained for review during VFC Compliance Visits and Unannounced Storage and Handling Visits. An example of the Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record can be found in the "Forms" section of the Provider Manual following the Temperature Recording Form.</p>

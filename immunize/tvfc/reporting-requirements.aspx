		<h2>About Reporting Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>The TVFC Program requires TVFC providers to monitor the temperatures of all refrigerators and freezers containing TVFC vaccines and to submit reports to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) utilizing TVFC Program forms documenting vaccine inventory and usage.</p>
		
		<p>All records related to the TVFC Program are required to be maintained for five years and made easily accessible.  These records include (but are not limited to):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Monthly Biological Report (EC-33)</li>
			<li>Biological Order Form (EC-68-1)</li>
			<li>Temperature Recording Form (EC-105), including
				<ul>
					<li>Refrigerator Fahrenheit (EC-105RF)</li>
					<li>Refrigerator Celsius (EC-105RC)</li>
					<li>Freezer Fahrenheit (EC-105FF)</li>
					<li>Freezer Celsius (EC-105FC)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Any other reports or required documents</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All forms are available on the <a title="TVFC Forms and Publications" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx">TVFC Forms and Publications</a> page.</p>

			<br/>
			<h3><a title="TVFC Publications Page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Monthly Biological Report (C-33-A)</a></h3>
			
			<p>The Monthly Biological Report is now documented in EVI as vaccine received, doses administered, vaccine transferred, vaccine loss, and physical count.  The Tally and Physical Count report in EVI may be used to help document vaccine management.</p>
			
			<p>Qualified TVFC providers who participate in the <a title="ASN Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/tvfc-asn.aspx">ASN Program</a> are required to distinguish between their adult and pediatric vaccines and order and report adult vaccines separately from TVFC pediatric vaccines.  The Combined Tally and Inventory Sheet is an optional form that may assist in tracking pediatric doses versus adult doses administered.</p>
			
			<p>For those providers without internet access, they must complete the <a title="Monthly Biological Report" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Monthly Biological Report</a> and submit it to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) each month.  The person completing the paper Monthly Biological Report must always sign and date the report and provide a telephone number where they can be reached.  This is required in case discrepancies are identified on the report and a follow-up phone call is needed.</p>

			<h3><a title="TVFC Publications Page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Biological Order Form (C-68)</a></h3>
			
			<p>This form is used only for initial orders or for those providers that do not have internet access. The Biological Order Form documents the amount of vaccine the clinic will order.  All vaccines must be ordered to bring the clinic up to their pre-determined MSL.  For orders above the MSL, an explanation is required in the comment section.</p>

			<h3><a title="TVFC Publications Page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Forms (EC-105-xx)</a></h3>
			<p>Completed Temperature Recording Forms for the previous month are to be submitted to the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).  A Temperature Recording Form is to be maintained on all refrigerators and freezers that store TVFC vaccine (including temporary day storage units).  Providers may choose to use Fahrenheit (C-105RF and C-105FF) or Celsius (C-105RC and C-105FC) forms.</p>
			
			<p>All TVFC vaccines are required to be maintained at proper storage temperatures at all times. To ensure proper temperatures are maintained, the TVFC Program requires providers to record refrigerator and/or freezer temperatures twice daily for all units that store TVFC vaccine. The TVFC providers are also required to record minimum and maximum temperatures since the last reading, at least once daily, preferably in the morning.  Results of each check must be documented on the Temperature Recording Form and the form must be initialed by the staff member conducting the check.  Any temperature excursions must be reported to the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) immediately.  Instructions for completing the Temperature Recording Form are listed on the top of the form.</p>
			
			<p>Providers must include the following information on the Troubleshooting Record:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Date and time of event</li>
				<li>Storage unit temperature</li>
				<li>Room temperature</li>
				<li>Name of person completing the report</li>
				<li>Description of the event</li>
				<li>Action taken-including the instructions and procedures given by the responsible entity </li>
				<li>SHS HSR or LHD) and the individual spoken to</li>
				<li>The results</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>All documentation regarding temperature deviations must be retained for review during the TVFC Compliance Visits and any Unannounced Storage and Handling Visits.</p>

		<h2>Monthly Requirements</h2>
		
		<p>On a monthly basis the following documents must be submitted to the responsibly entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) by the 5th of each month:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Monthly Biological Report (only if internet access is unavailable)</li>
			<li>Temperature Recording Form</li>
			<li>Biological Order Form (only if internet access is unavailable)</li>
			<li>Any additional and/or associated forms as required by the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD)</li>
		</ul>		
		
		<p>Monthly online vaccine management is required in EVI regardless of whether an order is submitted or not.  Any TVFC provider without internet access will need to continue to submit the Monthly Biological Report each month to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).</p>

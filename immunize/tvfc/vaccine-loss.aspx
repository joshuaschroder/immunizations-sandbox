	<h2>Expired, Spoiled and Wasted Vaccine</h2>
	
	<p>The Immunization Unit requires all unopened or unused vials and syringes of expired TVFC vaccines/toxoids/biologicals be returned to the third-party distributor (McKesson).  Vaccine manufacturers reimburse CDC for the federal excise tax portion of the cost of the vaccine. Therefore, providers should not discard any vaccine unless specifically directed by the DSHS Immunization Unit, DSHS HSR or LHD.  Any exception to this rule will be communicated by the DSHS Immunization Unit on a case-by-case basis.  Providers are to immediately notify the DSHS HSR or LHD of vaccine cold chain failure events or vaccine wastage incidents involving TVFC vaccines upon discovery of the incident. </p>
	
	<p><em>Expired or spoiled vaccine</em>: any nonviable vaccine in its original container (vial or syringe) that can be returned for excise tax credit.  This includes expired vaccine or vaccine that has been spoiled as a result of the following: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Natural disaster/power outage</li>
		<li>Refrigerator being too warm or too cold</li>
		<li>Failure to store vaccine properly upon receipt</li>
		<li>Vaccine spoiled in transit</li>
		<li>Mechanical failure</li>
		<li>Recall</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><em>Wasted vaccine</em>: any non-viable vaccine that cannot be returned for excise tax credit.  This includes:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Vaccine drawn into the syringe but not administered</li>
		<li>Vaccine in open vial multi-dose vial but not all doses administered</li>
		<li>Compromised vial (e.g., due to a drop causing damage to vial integrity or sterility), or broken vial</li>
		<li>Lost vial</li>
		<li>Vaccine drawn into the syringe but patient refuses it</li>
		<li>Incorrect vaccine prepared for patient</li>
		<li>Incorrect diluent drawn for vaccine</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Wasted and expired/spoiled vaccines should be removed from the storage unit to prevent inadvertent administration.  Wasted and expired/spoiled vaccine should be segregated, labeled “Do Not Use,” and stored pending return to distributor.  The third party distributor, McKesson, will document Texas losses and return vaccines to the manufacturer for excise tax credit.  All vaccine returns to McKesson must occur within six months.</p>
	
	<p>Diluents should be managed similar to vaccines; the expiration date of diluents should be checked prior to every reconstitution.  Providers should also rotate diluent stock to use the shortest expiration date first.  Expired diluents do not need to be returned.</p>
	
	<p>Vaccine loss must be documented on a Vaccine Loss Report electronically in EVI no later than four days past the date of the incident(s).</p>

	<h2>Procedures for Vaccine Loss</h2>
	
	<p>Every dose of vaccine that is lost (wasted, spoiled or expired) must be reported to the TVFC Program on a Vaccine Loss Report electronically generated in EVI.  Spoiled and expired vaccine must be returned to the distributor within 6 months of the loss.</p>
	
	<p>Providers are to follow the procedures listed below when vaccine loss occurs:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Remove expired/spoiled vaccine from the vaccine storage unit and place in a Vaccine Quarantine Bag.</li>
		<li>Contact your responsible entity (DSHS, HSR or LHD) immediately with the following information:
			<ul>
				<li>Antigen</li>
				<li>Lot number</li>
				<li>Expiration date and</li>
				<li>Reason for expiration/loss.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If storage was compromised, provide DSHS HSR or LHD with amount of time product was out-of-range and the highest and lowest temperatures recorded.</li>
		<li>Document the vaccine loss on the Vaccine Loss Report electronically generated in EVI within four days of the incident(s) of loss explaining the cause(s) of the loss and outlining the steps taken to ensure vaccines will be protected in the future.</li>
		<li>A printed form must be signed by the medical provider who signed the VFC Program Provider Agreement and emailed or faxed to the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).  The Vaccine Loss Report should be printed and then submitted to the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD), and is due within four days of the date of the loss.</li>
		<li>The Vaccine Loss Report includes the following sections:
			<ul>
				<li>Clinic demographics</li>
				<li>Date loss was discovered</li>
				<li>Type of loss</li>
				<li>Reason for loss</li>
				<li>Corrective action taken to avoid re-occurrence</li>
				<li>Explanation of loss and</li>
				<li>List of vaccines by antigen, manufacturer, lot number, expiration date, and number of doses lost.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>TVFC providers will receive a shipping label from McKesson for returning nonviable vaccine, if applicable.  If more than one box will be used, mark the boxes with "Box 1 of 2," "Box 2 of 2," etc.</li>
		<li>Providers must ensure that all and only vaccines listed on that Vaccine Loss Report are included in the box for return.  If more than one box is used to return nonviable vaccine, providers must indicate on the Vaccine Loss Report the number of the box in which the vaccine is being shipped (e.g., "Box 1 of 2," "Box 2 of 2," etc.).  A copy of the Vaccine Loss Report (including box number) should be included in each box when returning the non-viable vaccine.</li>
		<li>Any wasted vaccine listed on the Vaccine Loss Report (dropped or broken vials/syringes) should be marked through with a single line as they are not included in the box for return.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Only unbroken, sealed vaccine vials/syringes may be included for return.  Broken vials/syringes, open multi-dose vials, or exposed syringe needles should NEVER be included in the box.</p>
	
	<p>Providers will have to wait until UPS returns to their office with the next delivery to return the box with the nonviable vaccines.  If the provider calls to schedule a pickup, the provider will be charged a pick up fee.  McKesson will not schedule pickups on behalf of TVFC providers unless special arrangements are made by the DSHS Immunization Unit.</p>
	
	<p>TVFC providers who have lost vaccine as a result of improper temperature storage must assess how long the vaccines were stored improperly and how many children may have received the affected vaccines.  The provider should discuss the situation with the manufacturer to determine whether or not children will need to be recalled and revaccinated.</p>
	
	<p>The TVFC Program will not provide the vaccine for recalled children in these circumstances. The clinic will assume all financial responsibility for the cost of vaccines for recalls.  Providers must contact their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) with the determination from the manufacturer.</p>

	<h2>Expired, Spoiled and Wasted Vaccine</h2>
	<p>The Immunizations Unit requires all unopened or unused vials and syringes of expired TVFC vaccines/toxoids/biologicals be returned to the third-party distributor (McKesson). Vaccine manufacturers reimburse CDC for the federal excise tax portion of the cost of the vaccine. Therefore, providers should not discard any vaccine unless specifically directed by the DSHS Immunizations Unit, DSHS health service region or local health department. Any exception to this rule will be communicated by the DSHS Immunizations Unit on a case-by-case basis. Providers are to immediately notify the DSHS health service region or local health department of vaccine cold chain failure events or vaccine wastage incidents involving TVFC vaccines upon discovery of the incident.</p>
	<p><em>Expired or spoiled vaccine</em>: any nonviable vaccine in its original container (vial or syringe) that can be returned for excise tax credit. This includes expired vaccine or vaccine that has been spoiled as a result of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Natural disaster/power outage</li>
		<li>Refrigerator being too warm or too cold</li>
		<li>Failure to store vaccine properly upon receipt</li>
		<li>Vaccine spoiled in transit</li>
		<li>Mechanical failure</li>
		<li>Recall</li>
	</ul>
	<p><em>Wasted vaccine</em>: any non-viable vaccine that cannot be returned for excise tax credit. This includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vaccine drawn into the syringe but not administered</li>
		<li>Vaccine in open vial but doses not administered</li>
		<li>Compromised vial (e.g., due to a drop causing damage to vial integrity or sterility), broken vial, or lost vial</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Wasted and expired/spoiled vaccines should be removed from the storage unit to prevent inadvertent administration. Wasted and expired/spoiled vaccine should be segregated, labeled "Do Not Use," and stored pending return to distributor. The third party distributor, McKesson, will document Texas losses and return vaccines to the manufacturer for excise tax credit. All vaccine returns to McKesson must occur within six months.</p>
	<p>Diluents should be managed similar to vaccines; the expiration date of diluents should be checked prior to every reconstitution. Providers should also rotate diluent stock to use the shortest expiration date first. Expired diluents do not need to be returned.</p>
	<p>Vaccine loss must be documented on a Vaccine Loss Report electronically in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system no later than four days past the date of the incident(s).	</p>

<div class="Section" id="Short-Dated-Vaccine">
	<a class="bookmark" title="short-dated" name="short-dated"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Short Dated Vaccine</h2>
	<p>Placing orders according to the established MSLs and rotating vaccines so that shortest dated vaccines are used first will help to prevent losses due to expiration. Too much vaccine kept in inventory increases the risk of vaccine expiration and increases the amount of loss in the event of refrigerator failure. When ordering vaccines, providers should keep no more than the designated maximum stock level (MSL). Clinic staff should make note of vaccine expiration dates when physically counting on-hand inventory at the end the month. Vaccine with the shortest date must be used first.</p>
	<p>Providers are required to notify the DSHS health service region or local health department 90 days prior to vaccine expiration. If the vaccine cannot be used before expiration, the DSHS health service region or local health department will assist with re-distribution of the vaccine.	</p>

<div class="Section" id="Procedures-for-Vaccine-Loss">
	<a class="bookmark" title="procedures" name="procedures"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Procedures for Vaccine Loss</h2>
	<p>Every dose of vaccine that is lost (wasted, spoiled or expired) must be reported to the TVFC Program on a Vaccine Loss Report electronically generated in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system. Spoiled and expired vaccine must be returned to the distributor within 6 months of the loss.</p>
	<p>Providers are to follow the procedures listed below when vaccine loss occurs:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Remove expired/spoiled vaccine from the vaccine storage unit.</li>
		<li>Contact your responsible entity (DSHS health service region or local health department) immediately with the following information:
			<ul>
				<li>Antigen</li>
				<li>Lot number</li>
				<li>Expiration date</li>
				<li>Reason for expiration/loss</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If storage was compromised, provide DSHS health service region or local health department with amount of time product was out-of-range and the highest and lowest temperatures recorded.</li>
		<li>Document the vaccine loss on the Vaccine Loss Report electronically generated in EVI explaining the cause(s) of the loss and outlining the steps taken to ensure vaccines will be protected in the future.</li>
		<li>The Vaccine Loss Report should be printed and then submitted to the responsible entity, and is due within four days of the date of the loss.</li>
		<li>TVFC requires the completed Vaccine Loss Report to be signed or acknowledged by the medical provider who signed the VFC Program Provider Agreement. The Vaccine Loss Report includes the following sections:
			<ul>
				<li>Clinic demographics</li>
				<li>Date loss was discovered</li>
				<li>Type of loss</li>
				<li>Reason for loss</li>
				<li>Corrective action taken to avoid re-occurrence</li>
				<li>Explanation of loss</li>
				<li>List of vaccines by antigen, manufacturer, lot number, expiration date, and number of doses lost</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>TVFC providers will receive a shipping label from McKesson for returning nonviable vaccine, if applicable. If more than one box will be used, mark the boxes with "Box 1 of 2," "Box 2 of 2," etc.</li>
		<li>Providers must ensure that all and only vaccines listed on that Vaccine Loss Report are included in the box for return. If more than one box is used to return nonviable vaccine, providers must indicate on the Vaccine Loss Report the number of the box in which the vaccine is being shipped (e.g., "Box 1 of 2," "Box 2 of 2," etc.). A copy of the Vaccine Loss Report (including box number) should be included in each box when returning the non-viable vaccine.</li>
		<li>Any wasted vaccine listed on the Vaccine Loss Report (dropped or broken vials/syringes) should be marked through with a single line as they are not included in the box for return.	</li>
		<li>Important Note: Only unbroken, sealed vaccine vials/syringes may be included for return. Broken vials/syringes or exposed syringe needles should NEVER be included in the box.</li>
		<li>Providers will have to wait until UPS returns to their office with the next delivery to return the box with the nonviable vaccines. If the provider calls to schedule a pickup, the provider will be charged a pick up fee. McKesson will not schedule pickups on behalf of TVFC providers unless special arrangements are made by the DSHS Immunizations Unit.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>TVFC providers who have lost vaccine as a result of improper temperature storage must assess how long the vaccines were stored improperly and how many children may have received the affected vaccines. The provider should discuss the situation with the DSHS Pharmacy or manufacturer to determine whether or not children will need to be recalled and revaccinated. The TVFC Program will not provide the vaccine for recalled children in these circumstances. The clinic will assume all financial responsibility for the cost of vaccines for recalls. Providers must contact their responsible entity with the determination from the DSHS Pharmacy or manufacturer.</p>
	<p>TVFC providers will be held responsible for vaccine losses due to negligence. Vaccine negligence may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Vaccine stored improperly</li>
		<li>Vaccine left out of the refrigerator or the freezer</li>
		<li>Refrigerator or freezer unplugged (plug guard not used)</li>
		<li>Vaccine transported inappropriately (appropriate cold chain was not maintained)</li>
		<li>Improper monitoring of temperatures in refrigerator or freezer</li>
		<li>Allowing vaccine to expire without notifying the DSHS HSR or LHD 90 days in advance of the expiration date</li>
		<li>Refrigerator or freezer door left open</li>
		<li>Refusal of a vaccine shipment	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Certain vaccine loss circumstances may qualify for insurance policy reimbursement depending on the type of insurance your facility has. Loss of TVFC vaccine under the following circumstances may be covered by insurance:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Power outages due to inclement weather (e.g., flood, hurricane, freezing temperatures, tornado)</li>
		<li>Fire</li>
		<li>Robbery</li>
	</ul>

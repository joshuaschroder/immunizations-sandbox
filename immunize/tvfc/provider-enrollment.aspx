<p>By enrolling in TVFC, <a title="eligible providers" href="/immunize/tvfc/provider-eligibility.aspx">eligible providers</a> can provide innumerable benefits to the families in your practice, and to the people of Texas. One of the most important benefits is removing barriers to immunizations. For instance, you will no longer have to refer an uninsured child to a public health center for immunizations. TVFC removes the burden of the financial cost of vaccines, thereby eliminating the need to refer clients. Children are then kept in their "medical home," which is beneficial to the provider and client. Families who are currently paying for vaccinations may be TVFC eligible.</p>

<h2>Who Benefits from My Participation?</h2>
<p>Under TVFC, the following groups of children (birth through 18 years of age) should receive low-cost vaccines: uninsured or underinsured children, children who are covered by CHIP, children who are of Native American or Native Alaskan heritage, and children on Medicaid.</p>
<p>There are cost savings of immunizing versus treatment for diseases to taxpayers. For example, for every dollar spent on DTaP vaccine, $27.00 is saved in direct and indirect costs. Additionally, vaccine contracts are negotiated at a federal level, thus ensuring the lowest price and a standardized cost. Vaccine is ordered through regional state offices and is supplied to providers at no cost. A TVFC provider may not charge for the vaccine, but is permitted to charge a reasonable administration fee.</p>

<h2>How Will TVFC Change my Practice?</h2>
<p>TVFC does not tell enrolled providers whom they must see or dictate that they accept Medicaid clients. Providers continue to serve the same populations they have always served. Except now, through enrollment in the TVFC, more children will be receiving their complete series of immunizations. This benefits everyone by maintaining a higher level of immunity in our community. TVFC automatically covers all vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>A fully immunized society is necessary to reach optimum eradication of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. With your help, we can reach these goals leading to a healthier Texas.</p>

If the agreement is terminated, the office and/or facility agrees to return all TVFC vaccines.</li>
</ul>

<p>In jurisdictions where there are mass vaccinators enrolled, or circumstances where the enrolled provider is not providing direct services and other parties are involved with administering the vaccines, all parties involved with implementing the clinics, including the physician, medical director, and other groups who are directly administering the vaccine, must sign the provider agreement.  There must be a written agreement attached to the VFC Program Provider Agreement detailing the responsibilities of each party involved.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="initial-enrollment" name="initial-enrollment"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Initial Enrollment</h3>
<p>When a provider joins the TVFC Program, a VFC Program Provider Agreement and Cover Letter providing instructions for completion are faxed to the provider.  Assistance with filling out the forms is provided via telephone to those providers who request it.  The <a title="VFC Program Provider Agreement" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx">VFC Program Provider Agreement</a> is also available on the DSHS Immunization Unit website.</p>

<p>The <a title="VFC Program Provider Agreement Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">VFC Program Provider Agreement Form</a> must be completed at initial enrollment and updated annually.  The agreement includes basic information about the facility and responsible provider.  It also briefly outlines the provider’s responsibilities.  The VFC Program Provider Agreement signed by the responsible health care professional must be received and processed by the TVFC Program prior to the clinic receiving state and federally-funded vaccines.</p>

<p>All licensed health care providers (MD, DO, NP, CNM, PA, or RPh) at the facility who have prescribing authority must be listed on the VFC Program Provider Agreement.  The listing must also include the signing provider’s information.  Information required for the health care providers include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provider Name</li>
	<li>Title</li>
	<li>Texas Medical / Nursing/Pharmacy License Number</li>
	<li>National Provider Identification (NPI)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the primary provider who signed the VFC Program Provider Agreement leaves the practice, the VFC Program Provider Agreement must be updated at that time and signed by the new primary health care provider.</p>

<p>The VFC Program Provider Profile Form requests information about the provider’s patient population, which includes the projection and identification of clients the clinic will serve in the upcoming year.  Providers must provide accurate data from the previous 12 months and must include the number of insured patients.  These numbers must be specific to the clinic site and not combined with other clinics’ patient numbers.  Data sources must include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Immunization registry</li>
	<li>Benchmarking</li>
	<li>Number of Medicaid Claims or other billing data</li>
	<li>Client encounter data</li>
</ul>

<p>The responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD), Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Health Service Region (HSR), or Local Health Department (LHD) will assist the provider through the enrollment process.  The provider must designate two staff members as the  primary and secondary TVFC vaccine coordinators.  The two staff members will be informed by the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) about how to complete the two required <a title="CDC You Call the Shots" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html">CDC You Call the Shots</a> training modules upon initial enrollment.  The <em>CDC You Call the Shots</em> training modules must be completed prior to enrollment and the Certificates of Completion must be included with the VFC Program Provider Agreement Form when it is returned to the DSHS HSR responsible for the county in which the provider is located.  The provider may also choose to enroll in the <a title="Texas Immunization Registry (ImmTrac)" href="http://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/ImmTrac/">Texas Immunization Registry (ImmTrac)</a> at this time.  If the provider chooses to enroll, they will be provided information on how to access the ImmTrac Registry form online, and to whom the completed form should be submitted.</p>

<p>The TVFC Program checks the <a title="Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals or Entities" href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/">Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals or Entities</a> to ensure that a pending provider is eligible to participate in the TVFC Program.</p>

<p>Once the forms are approved by the TVFC Program, the provider’s office is issued a Provider Identification Number (PIN).  The PIN will be the clinic’s vaccine account number for the duration that the clinic is enrolled in the TVFC Program.</p>

<p>The PIN is required to be included on all TVFC forms and communications.  Providers should enter their TVFC PIN into their ImmTrac user account.  Information regarding ImmTrac may be found on the <a title="documentation requirements page" href="/immunize/tvfc/documentation-requirements.aspx">documentation requirements page</a> and on the <a title="ImmTrac webpage" href="/immunize/immtrac">ImmTrac webpage</a>. </p>

<p>The provider’s office will be contacted by the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) at this time, to schedule New Provider Training.</p>


<a class="bookmark" title="enrollment-visit" name="enrollment-visit"></a>
<br/>
<h3>TVFC Enrollment Visit</h3>

<p>All providers enrolling in the TVFC Program must receive an enrollment visit prior to receiving any vaccine through the TVFC Program.  When the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) visits the provider’s office, a review of all storage units in the provider’s office is performed to ensure <a title="adequate and approved storage units" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx">adequate and approved storage units</a> are being used.  A certified and calibrated data logger and / or thermometer is placed in all units that will store the TVFC vaccine at this time, and logged for 10 business days before any TVFC vaccine is supplied.</p>

<p>New Provider Training is also conducted on all TVFC Program policies to ensure that they are understood and followed.  Two provider staff members must be designated as the primary and secondary TVFC vaccine coordinators and are required to attend the training.  The two staff members must also complete the two <a title="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html">CDC You Call the Shots</a> training modules and submit the Certificates of Completion to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="vaccine-accountability" name="vaccine-accountability"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Vaccine Accountability</h3>
<p>Vaccine accountability is a cornerstone of the TVFC Program and one of highest priorities for the DSHS Immunization Unit.  All TVFC providers must ensure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Vaccines provided to them through the TVFC Program are administered only to <a title="TVFC-eligible children" href="/immunize/tvfc/patient-eligibility.aspx">TVFC-eligible children</a></li>
	<li><a title="Vaccine loss and waste" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-loss.aspx">Vaccine loss and waste</a> are minimized and documented</li>
	<li>The TVFC Program is proactively protected against <a title="fraud and abuse" href="/immunize/tvfc/fraud-abuse.aspx">fraud and abuse</a></li>
	<li>TVFC and other federally and state-purchased vaccines are ordered appropriately based on a provider’s TVFC-eligible population</li>
	<li>TVFC vaccine inventory is <a title="accurately reported" href="/immunize/tvfc/reporting-requirements.aspx">accurately reported</a> on a monthly basis</li>
	<li>Every TVFC provider is required to submit a <a title="VFC Program Provider Enrollment Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx">VFC Program Provider Enrollment Form</a> at the time of initial enrollment and annually thereafter.  By signing the VFC Program Provider Enrollment, the TVFC providers agree to the accountability requirements as a condition of participation in the TVFC program.  The provider agrees to:
		<ul>
			<li>Screen patients at all immunization encounters for TVFC eligibility and administer TVFC purchased vaccine only to TVFC-eligible patients</li>
			<li>Comply with the requirements for ordering, vaccine accountability, and vaccine management</li>
			<li>Operate within the TVFC Program in a manner intended to prevent fraud and abuse</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<a class="bookmark" title="provider-PIN" name="provider-PIN"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Provider Identification Number (PIN)</h3>
<p>A Provider Identification Number (PIN) will be assigned to the provider upon initial enrollment into the TVFC Program.  The PIN will be the clinic’s vaccine account number for the duration that the clinic is enrolled in the TVFC Program.  The PIN is required to be included on all TVFC forms and communications.  Providers should enter their TVFC PIN into their ImmTrac user account.  Information regarding ImmTrac may be found on the <a title="Documentation Requirements" href="/immunize/tvfc/documentation-requirements.aspx">Documentation Requirements</a> page and on the <a title="ImmTrac webpage" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/immunize/immtrac/default.shtm">ImmTrac webpage</a>.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="provider-change" name="provider-change"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Provider Change of Information</h3>
<p>It is the TVFC provider’s responsibility to maintain correct demographics, days and hours available to receive vaccine shipments, and profile information in the EVI system.  The TVFC Program requires that when a provider changes location or if there is a new provider staff member acting as the primary and / or secondary TVFC vaccine coordinator, the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) must be contacted immediately to inform them of the change.  In addition, the TVFC Program requires that the provider update the information in EVI.  New primary or secondary contacts are required to complete the <a title="CDC You Call the Shots training" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html">CDC You Call the Shots training</a>.</p>
<p>The VFC Program Provider Agreement and Provider Profile Forms must also be updated if the provider’s patient population changes and / or when the provider who signed the form is no longer associated with the clinic.</p>
<p>Failure to properly update current clinic information may result in vaccine delays and possible vaccine loss.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="re-enrollment" name="re-enrollment"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Annual Re-Enrollment</h3>

<p>Beginning in 2017, provider re-enrollment will take place in November for the following year. The TVFC Program requires that the <a title="VFC Program Provider Agreement and Provider Profile Forms" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">VFC Program Provider Agreement and Provider Profile Forms</a> be updated annually.  These forms are required for continued enrollment in the TVFC Program. </p>
<p>The TVFC provider’s assigned primary and secondary TVFC vaccine coordinators are required to complete an online re-enrollment and the two required <a title="CDC You Call the Shots training" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html">CDC You Call the Shots training</a> modules.  Certificates of Completion for both modules must be included with the completed, printed, and signed enrollment form and submitted to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).</p>
<p>Providers enrolled in both the TVFC and the Adult Safety Net (ASN) Programs are required to submit a completed ASN Enrollment form along with the TVFC re-enrollment form and training certificates.  Please refer to the <a title="ASN Provider Manual" href="/immunize/ASN/">ASN Provider Manual</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>Vaccine shipments may be interrupted if the TVFC providers do not have current enrollment information on file.</p>


<a class="bookmark" title="deputization" name="deputization"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Deputization of Clinics</h3>
<p>Deputization is used to identify areas where the FQHC / RHC is unable to serve the current underinsured population.  If the FQHC / RHC is unable to serve the population then the DSHS HSRs and LHDs are the second line to serve as a "safety net" for the underinsured.  Texas has implemented deputization of public health department clinics and LHD’s.  Delegation of Authority (DOA) or deputization, allows Texas FQHCs and RHCs to delegate authority for vaccinating underinsured children.  Underinsured served in FQHC, RHC, or deputized sites are eligible for federal VFC vaccine according to federal guidance.</p>

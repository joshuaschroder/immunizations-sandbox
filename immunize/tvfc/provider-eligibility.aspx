<h2>Web-Based Training</h2>
<p>The  <a title="You Call the Shots" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html">CDC "You Call the Shots" annual training modules</a> must be completed prior to enrollment and the certificates of completion for this training must be included with the <a title="VFC Provider Agreement Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">Provider Agreement Form</a> when it is returned to the HSR responsible for the county in which the provider is located.</p>
<p>Vaccine viability depends on the knowledge and habits of the clinic staff. All staff who handle TVFC vaccine should be trained on proper storage, handling, and administration of vaccine. The facility is required to designate a primary and at least one back-up vaccine coordinator to ensure that TVFC vaccines are handled and stored properly. Both employees are required to complete the mandatory CDC "You Call the Shots" training modules annually and provide the Certificates of Completion to their DSHS HSR.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="initial-enrollment" name="initial-enrollment"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>Initial Enrollment</h2>
<p>The <a title="VFC Program Provider Agreement Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">VFC Program Provider Agreement Form</a> must be completed at initial enrollment and updated annually. The Provider Agreement includes basic information about the facility and responsible provider. It also briefly outlines the provider’s responsibilities. The VFC Program Provider Agreement signed by the responsible health care professional must be received and processed by DSHS prior to the clinic receiving state and federally-funded vaccines.</p>
<p>All licensed health care providers (MD, DO, NP, CNM, PA, or RPh) at the facility who have prescribing authority must be listed on the TVFC Provider Agreement. The listing must include the signing provider’s information. Information required for the healthcare providers include:</p>

	<li>Provider Name</li>
	<li>Title</li>
	<li>Texas Medical License Number</li>
	<li>National Provider Identification (NPI)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the primary provider who signed the Provider Agreement leaves the practice, the Provider Agreement must be updated at that time and signed by the new primary health care professional.</p>
<p>The Provider Profile includes the projection and identification of clients the clinic will serve in the upcoming year. The Provider Profile Form requests information about the provider’s patient population. Providers must provide accurate data from the previous 12 months. These numbers must be specific to the clinic site and not combined with other clinics’ patient numbers. Data sources may include, but are not limited to, immunization registry, benchmarking, number of Medicaid Claims or other billing data, as well as client encounter data.</p>
<p>The TVFC Program checks the <a title="Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals or Entities" href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/">Office of the Inspector General’s (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals or Entities</a> to ensure that a pending provider is eligible to participate in the TVFC Program.</p>

<p>Temperatures must be logged and in range for fourteen days before the provider is authorized to store TVFC vaccine.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="vaccine-accountability" name="vaccine-accountability"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>Vaccine Accountability</h2>
<p>Vaccine accountability is a cornerstone of the TVFC Program and one of highest priorities for DSHS. TVFC providers must ensure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Vaccines purchased with TVFC funds are administered only to TVFC-eligible children</li>
	<li><a title="Vaccine loss and waste" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-loss.aspx">Vaccine loss and waste</a> are minimized</li>
	<li>The TVFC Program is protected against <a title="fraud and abuse" href="/immunize/tvfc/fraud-abuse.aspx">fraud and abuse</a></li>
	<li>TVFC and other federally and state-purchased vaccines are ordered appropriately based on a provider’s TVFC-eligible population</li>
	<li>TVFC vaccine inventory is <a title="accurately reported" href="/immunize/tvfc/reporting-requirements.aspx">accurately reported</a> on a monthly basis</li>
</ul>

<a class="bookmark" title="provider-PIN" name="provider-PIN"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>Provider Identification Number (PIN)</h2>
<p>A Provider Identification Number (PIN) will be assigned to the provider upon initial enrollment into the TVFC Program. The PIN will be the clinic’s vaccine account number for the duration that the clinic is enrolled in the TVFC Program. The PIN is required to be included on all TVFC forms and communications. Providers should enter their TVFC PIN into their ImmTrac user account. Information regarding ImmTrac may be found ion the <a title="Documentation Requirements" href="/immunize/tvfc/documentation-requirements.aspx">Documentation Requirements</a> page and on the <a title="ImmTrac webpage" href="http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/immunize/immtrac/default.shtm">ImmTrac webpage</a>.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="provider-change" name="provider-change"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>Provider Change of Information</h2>
<p>It is the provider’s responsibility to maintain correct demographics, days and hours available to receive vaccine shipments, and profile information in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system. TVFC requires that when a provider changes location that the responsible entity (DSHS, Health Service Region, or Local Health Department) be contacted immediately to inform them of the change. In addition, TVFC requires that the provider update the information in EVI.</p>
<p>Failure to properly update current information may result in vaccine delays and possible vaccine loss.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="re-enrollment" name="re-enrollment"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>Annual Re-Enrollment</h2>
<p>The annual re-enrollment period is from January 1 through March 31. TVFC requires that the <a title="VFC Program Provider Agreement and Provider Profile Forms" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">VFC Program Provider Agreement and Provider Profile Forms</a> be updated annually. The VFC Program Provider Agreement and Provider Profile Forms must also be updated if the provider’s patient population changes and/or when the provider who signed the form is no longer associated with the clinic. Vaccine shipments may be interrupted if TVFC providers do not have current enrollment information on file. Providers are required to complete the “You Call the Shots” Module 10 - Vaccine Storage and Handling and Module 16 - Vaccines for Children annual training prior to re-enrolling. Certificates of completion must be included with the re-enrollment forms.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="deputization" name="deputization"></a>
<hr/>
<h2>Deputization of Clinics</h2>
<p>In an effort to increase the number of children who are eligible for federal entitlement vaccine and ensure state compliance with the federal VFC eligibility, Texas has implemented deputization of public health department clinics. Delegation of Authority (DOA) or deputization, allows Texas federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and rural health centers (RHCs) to confer authority for vaccinating underinsured children. Underinsured served in FQHC/RHC or deputized sites are eligible for federal VFC vaccine according to federal guidance.</p>

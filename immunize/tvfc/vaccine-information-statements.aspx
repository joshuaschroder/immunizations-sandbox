<h2>Legal Requirement for Vaccine Information Statements</h2>
<p>Federal law requires all immunization providers (regardless of whether they are enrolled in the TVFC Program) to provide a parent, guardian, or other responsible adult a current Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for each vaccine the child is to receive, every time a vaccine is administered. Providers should ensure they are using the most current version of each VIS.</p> 

<hr/>
<h2>Downloadable Copies</h2>
<p>Printable copies of VIS documents may be downloaded directly from the <a title="Immunizations Unit VIS page" href="/immunize/literature/litlist.shtm">Immunizations Unit VIS page</a>, which contains the most current VIS documents produced by the CDC.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Ordering Printed Copies</h2>
<p>Printed copies of VIS may be ordered online and shipped in approximately 7 to 10 business days via the <a title="Immunizations Unit Literature Order Form" href="https://secure.immunizetexasorderform.com/">Immunizations Unit Literature Order Form</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Literature Order Form may contain VIS that are not the most current version. If no medically relevant information has been changed since the last revision, then the previous edition may continue to be used until existing stocks are depleted as per instructions listed on the <a title="CDC VIS updates page" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/what-is-new.html">CDC VIS updates page</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>VIS in Other Languages</h2>
<p>Providers should take reasonable steps to provide information in the appropriate languages in order to ensure clients with limited English proficiency are effectively informed. VISs in more than 20 additional languages can be downloaded from the <a title="Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) website" href="http://www.immunize.org/vis">Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) website</a>.</p>

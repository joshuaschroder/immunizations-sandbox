<h2>Legal Requirement for Vaccine Information Statements</h2>

<p>All immunization providers (regardless of whether they are enrolled in the TVFC Program) are required by the National Vaccine Childhood Injury Act (NCVIA-42 U.S.C. ยง 300ss-26) to provide a patient, parent, guardian, or other responsible adult a current <a title="Immunizations Unit VIS page" href="/immunize/literature/litlist.shtm">Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)</a>.  The appropriate VIS must be given prior to the vaccination, and must be given prior to each dose of a multi-dose series.</p>
	
<p>The VIS informs the client and their parent, guardian, or other responsible adult about the benefits and risks of the vaccine the child/patient is receiving.  The VIS must be given prior to every dose of vaccine being administered.</p>

<p>Providers should ensure they are using the most current version of each VIS.  A list of current VIS dates for each vaccine can be found on the <a title="Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) VIS page" href="http://www.immunize.org/vis">Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) VIS page</a>.</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Ways of Providing Patients with VIS</h2>

<p>Providers may provide the VIS as a paper copy or in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A permanent, laminated, office copy of each VIS, which may be read prior to vaccination</li>
	<li>Reviewed on a computer monitor or video display</li>
	<li>Downloaded by the client, parent, guardian, or other responsible adult to a smartphone or other electronic device</li>
</ul>

<p>The VISs can be made available to be read before the immunization visit from a copy that was given to the patient, parent, guardian, or other responsible adult, or by telling them how to download or view a copy from the internet.  They must still be offered a copy in one of the formats mentioned above to be read during the immunization visit, as a reminder.</p>

<p>Providers must offer a copy (which can be an electronic copy) of each appropriate VIS to take away following the vaccination.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Downloadable Copies</h2>

<p>Printable copies of VIS documents may be downloaded directly from the <a title="Immunizations Unit VIS page" href="/immunize/literature/litlist.shtm">Immunizations Unit VIS page</a>, which contains the most current VIS documents produced by the CDC.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Ordering Printed Copies</h2>

<p>Printed copies of VIS may be ordered online and shipped in approximately 7 to 10 business days via the <a title="Immunizations Unit Literature Order Form" href="https://secure.immunizetexasorderform.com/">Immunizations Unit Literature Order Form</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Literature Order Form may contain VIS that are not the most current version. If no medically relevant information has been changed since the last revision, then the previous edition may continue to be used until existing stocks are depleted as per instructions listed on the <a title="CDC VIS updates page" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/what-is-new.html">CDC VIS updates page</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>VIS in Other Languages</h2>
<p>Providers must take reasonable steps to provide information in the appropriate languages in order to ensure patients with limited English proficiency are effectively informed.  All VISs are available in more than 20 languages and can be downloaded from the <a title="Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) website" href="http://www.immunize.org/vis">Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) website</a>.</p>

<p>The routine re-distribution of TVFC vaccine is not allowed.  However, vaccine transport can be allowed between TVFC providers when necessary to avoid vaccine loss.  If a transfer must occur, TVFC providers are required to submit a <a title="TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form (EC-67)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form (EC-67)</a> to their DSHS HSR and receive pre-approval prior to conducting vaccine transfers. The TVFC provider can then initialize a vaccine transfer as long as they have the TVFC Program PIN of where they are transferring the vaccine.  The transfer information is captured and tracked in EVI.</p>

<p>To conduct a vaccine transfer, the TVFC provider, or authorized designee, who is transferring the vaccine, must do the following:</p>


<ul>
	<li>Ensure that the vaccine transfer is for one of the following required reasons:
		<ul>
			<li>Short dated vaccine</li>
			<li>Withdrawal, suspension or termination of a TVFC provider from the TVFC Program</li>
			<li>Other (emergency situations)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Complete and sign the TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form and agree that the vaccine will be transferred in accordance to TVFC Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines to ensure the proper cold chain will be maintained throughout the transfer process.  Each vaccine to be transferred must be listed on a separate row on the Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form and include:
		<ul>
			<li>The vaccine type</li>
			<li>The National Drug Code (NDC)</li>
			<li>The lot number</li>
			<li>The expiration date</li>
			<li>The number of doses that are being transferred</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Fax the completed TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form to their DSHS HSR.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For emergency situations, TVFC providers must call their DSHS HSR prior to faxing the <a title="TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form (EC-67)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form (EC-67)</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Once the DSHS HSR approves the transfer (within two business days), a signed copy of the form will be faxed or emailed to the TVFC provider requesting the transfer and the LHD (if applicable).  Once the TVFC provider receives the approval fax or email from the DSHS HSR, the TVFC provider may conduct the transfer in EVI</li>
	<li>Ensure that the vaccine is packaged using proper cold chain management as detailed on the <a title=" Chain Management section of the Vaccine Storage and Handling page" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx#cold-chain">Cold Chain Management section of the Vaccine Storage and Handling page</a>, and a certified, calibrated data logger or thermometer is enclosed with the packaged vaccine</li>
	<li>Include a copy of the EVI Transfer Form in the transfer package.  The EVI Transfer Form is printed after the transfer is conducted in EVI.</li>
	<li>Include a Temperature Recording Form to document temperatures before, during, and upon conclusion of the vaccine transfer.  The TVFC provider taking possession of the vaccine will append the Temperature Recording Form from the transfer to the monthly Temperature Recording Form.</li>
</ul>

<p>The TVFC provider taking possession of the vaccine must keep the TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form on file for a minimum of five years and made easily available.</p>

<p>To conduct a vaccine transfer, the TVFC provider, or authorized designee, who is transferring the vaccine, must do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ensure that the vaccine transfer is for one of the following reasons:
		<ul>
			<li>Overstock of vaccine</li>
			<li>Short dated vaccine</li>
			<li>Withdrawal of a provider from the TVFC Program</li>
			<li>Replenishing another clinic's inventory</li>
			<li>Other (emergency situations)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Complete and sign the <a title="TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form (EC-67)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form (EC-67)</a> and agree that the vaccine will be transferred in accordance to DSHS vaccine storage and handling guidelines (to ensure the proper cold chain will be maintained throughout the transfer process). Each vaccine that is going to be transferred must be listed on a separate row on the Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form and include the vaccine type, the National Drug Code, the lot number, the expiration date and the number of doses that are being transferred.</li>
	<li>Fax the completed Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form to the appropriate DSHS health service region. Note: For emergency situations, providers must call the DSHS health service region prior to faxing the TVFC Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form.</li>
	<li>Once the DSHS health service region approves the transfer (within 2 business days), a signed copy of the form will be faxed or emailed to both the provider requesting the transfer and the local health department (if applicable). Once the provider receives the approval fax or email from the DSHS health service region, the provider may conduct the transfer in EVI.</li>
	<li>Ensure that vaccine is packaged using proper cold chain management and a certified, calibrated thermometer is enclosed with the packaged vaccine.</li>
	<li>Include a copy of the EVI Transfer Form in the transfer package. The EVI Transfer Form is printed after the transfer is conducted in EVI.</li>
	<li>Include a <a title="Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)</a> to document temperatures before, during, and at the conclusion of the vaccine transfer. The provider taking possession of the vaccine will append the Temperature Recording Form from the transfer to the monthly Temperature Recording Form.</li>
</ol>
<p>The TVFC provider taking possession of the vaccine must keep the Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form on file for a minimum of five years.</p>

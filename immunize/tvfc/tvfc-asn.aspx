	<h2>Adult Safety Net Overview</h2>
	<p>Texas has a significant number of adults who have not received recommended vaccinations. This population is at an increased risk of contracting vaccine preventable diseases. The <a title="Adult Safety Net (ASN) Program" href="/immunize/ASN/">Adult Safety Net (ASN) Program</a> helps to address this important public health issue by providing publically purchased adult vaccines at no cost to enrolled medical providers to vaccinate ASN eligible clients.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Eligible-Provider-Types">
	<a class="bookmark" title="provider-eligibility" name="provider-eligibility"></a>

<div class="Section" id="Provider-Enrollment">
	<a class="bookmark" title="provider-enrollment" name="provider-enrollment"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Provider Enrollment</h2>
	<p>To enroll in the ASN Program, providers must be enrolled in TVFC. Prospective ASN providers must complete the <a title="ASN Enrollment Form" href="/immunize/ASN/Providers.shtm">ASN Enrollment Form</a> and submit the form to their responsible entity (DSHS health service region or local health department). All ASN providers must agree to comply with the policies and requirements of both the TVFC Program and the ASN Program.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Patient-Eligibility">
	<a class="bookmark" title="patient-eligibility" name="patient-eligibility"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Patient Eligibility</h2>
	<p>Adults aged nineteen years and older who have no medical insurance are eligible to receive ASN vaccine. Those with medical insurance, including Medicare, Medicaid, or any other insurance are not eligible to receive ASN vaccines. In addition, those who are underinsured (have insurance that does not cover immunizations) are not eligible to receive ASN vaccines.</p>
	<p>Eligibility status must be screened and documented on the <a title="Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#patient-eligibility">Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)</a> when administering any ASN vaccine. Using the Adult Eligibility Screening Record will ensure program accountability and client eligibility. This form must be retained for a minimum of five years and made available upon request from the responsible entity (DSHS health service region or the local health department).</p>
	<p>Individuals who are 19 years of age and previously initiated a vaccination series under the TVFC Program, but have not completed the series, may complete the series using ASN vaccines, regardless of their current health insurance status. The vaccine must be administered by an ASN provider at a DSHS health service region or local health department clinic. This provision only applies to individuals that have not yet reached their 20th birthday, after that point, the provision no longer applies.	</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Administration-Fee">
	<a class="bookmark" title="administration-fee" name="administration-fee"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Administration Fee</h2>
	<p>Providers may charge ASN clients an administration fee of up to $25.00 per dose. However, providers cannot deny the administration of vaccine if a client is unable to pay the administration fee. Providers may not send a patient to collections or charge fees for the patient's inability to pay administration fees.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Vaccine-Formulary">
	<a class="bookmark" title="vaccine-formulary" name="vaccine-formulary"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Vaccine Formulary</h2>
	<p>The current ASN vaccine formulary includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hepatitis A Vaccine</li>
		<li>Hepatitis B Vaccine</li>
		<li>Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B Combination Vaccine (Twinrix&#174;)</li>
		<li>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine</li>
		<li>Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) Vaccine</li>
		<li>Meningococcal Vaccine</li>

		<li>Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine</li>
		<li>Varicella Vaccine</li>
		<li>Zoster Vaccine</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ASN sites that have other adult vaccines remaining in their inventory from previous orders may continue to provide these vaccines to eligible clients until the stock is depleted.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Vaccine-Storage">
	<a class="bookmark" title="vaccine-storage" name="vaccine-storage"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Vaccine Storage</h2>
	<p>ASN providers are required to follow all <a title="TVFC storage and handling guidelines" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx">TVFC storage and handling guidelines</a> at all times. If a provider administers both ASN and TVFC vaccines, the publicly-funded adult vaccines must be stored separately from the TVFC vaccines. Also, ASN vaccines must be stored separately from privately-purchased adult vaccines.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Mobile-Vaccination-Clinics">
	<a class="bookmark" title="mobile-vaccination-clinics" name="mobile-vaccination-clinics"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Mobile Vaccination Clinics</h2>
	<p>ASN providers may conduct off-site, mobile vaccination clinics using ASN vaccine. However, ASN eligibility needs to be determined through use of the <a title="Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#patient-eligibility">Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)</a> for all clients that receive ASN vaccine. Additionally, required vaccine storage and handling guidelines must be followed at all times and the vaccine must be returned to the original approved vaccine storage unit at the end of each day. Vaccines are extremely sensitive to temperature excursions. Any exposure to out-of-range temperatures could make the vaccine non-viable. For this reason it is important to regularly monitor the temperature of vaccines and take quick action when temperature excursions occur.</p>

<div class="Section" id="Advertisement-of-ASN-Vaccine-by-Provider">
	<a class="bookmark" title="advertisement" name="advertisement"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Advertisement of ASN Vaccine by Provider</h2>
	<p>Providers may advertise and promote the availability of ASN vaccines to eligible clients.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Reporting-Doses-Administered">
	<a class="bookmark" title="reporting" name="reporting"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Reporting Doses Administered</h2>
	<p>All ASN vaccine doses administered are to be reported as "19 and over" in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system, under the "Doses" tab. Providers are required to accurately report all doses provided to adults. The DSHS Immunizations Unit uses this information to account for adult usage and to project and maintain supply.</p>

	<h2>Adult Safety Net Overview</h2>
	
	<p>The DSHS <a title="Adult Safety Net (ASN) Program" href="/immunize/ASN/">Adult Safety Net (ASN) Program</a> was developed to ensure that adults who ordinarily seek services through the DSHS HSRs or LHDs have access to the recommended adult vaccines.  Texas has a significant number of adults who have not received the recommended vaccinations and are at an increased risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases.  The ASN Program helps to address this important public health issue by providing adult vaccines at no cost to enrolled medical providers and making vaccines accessible to the uninsured adult population of Texas.  Only uninsured adults who have no health insurance coverage meet the criteria to receive ASN vaccines.</p>

<div class="Section" id="Eligible-Provider-Types">
	<a class="bookmark" title="provider-eligibility" name="provider-eligibility"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Eligible Provider Types</h2>
	
	<p>Provider types that may enroll in the ASN Program include, but may not be limited to, public clinics that are formally recognized as one of the following:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>DSHS Health Service Region (HSR) Offices</li>
		<li>Local Health Departments (LHDs)</li>
		<li>Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)</li>
		<li>Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)</li>
		<li>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Clinics</li>
		<li>Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinics</li>

<div class="Section" id="Provider-Enrollment">
	<a class="bookmark" title="provider-enrollment" name="provider-enrollment"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Provider Enrollment</h2>
	<p>To enroll in the ASN Program, providers must be enrolled in TVFC. Prospective ASN providers must complete the <a title="ASN Enrollment Form" href="/immunize/ASN/providers.aspx">ASN Enrollment Form</a> and submit the form to their responsible entity (DSHS health service region or local health department). All ASN providers must agree to comply with the policies and requirements of both the TVFC Program and the ASN Program.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Patient-Eligibility">
	<a class="bookmark" title="patient-eligibility" name="patient-eligibility"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Patient Eligibility</h2>
	
	<p>Only adults aged 19 years and older who are uninsured are eligible to receive ASN vaccines. Those with medical insurance, including Medicare or Medicaid are not eligible to receive ASN vaccines.  In addition, those who are underinsured (have insurance that does not cover immunizations) are not eligible to receive ASN vaccines.</p>
	
	<p>Patients who are 19 years of age and who previously initiated a vaccination series under the TVFC Program, but have not completed the series, may complete the series using vaccines provided thru the ASN Program.  A participating ASN provider can administer the vaccines, regardless of the patient’s current health insurance status.  This provision only applies to patients that have not yet reached their 20th birthday.</p>
	
	<p>All ASN providers are required to maintain a record of the eligibility status of adults receiving the vaccines.  Eligibility status must be screened for and documented on the <a title="Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#patient-eligibility">Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)</a>, when administering any ASN vaccine.  Records must be maintained by the clinic providing the service.  Information must be stored in the medical record either on paper, or in an EMR such as the Texas Wide Immunization Client Encounter System (TWICES).  All ASN providers are required to screen for eligibility each time a patient present for a vaccine.</p>
	
	<p>The Adult Eligibility Screening Record determines and records eligibility for the ASN Program. Copies must be maintained for five years and made available on request by the TVFC Program, the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD), or DSHS quality assurance contractor.</p>
	
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Administration-Fee">
	<a class="bookmark" title="administration-fee" name="administration-fee"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Administration Fee</h2>
	<p>Each ASN provider may charge ASN patients an administration fee of up to $25.00 per dose and is subject to change.  The ASN provider will be notified by the TVFC Program regarding any changes to the administration fee.</p>
	<p>An ASN provider cannot deny the administration of vaccines if a client is unable to pay the administration fee.  In addition, an ASN provider may not send a patient to collections or charge a fee for the patient’s inability to pay the administration fee.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Vaccine-Formulary">
	<a class="bookmark" title="vaccine-formulary" name="vaccine-formulary"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Vaccine Formulary</h2>
	<p>The current ASN vaccine formulary includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hepatitis A Vaccine</li>

<div class="Section" id="Vaccine-Storage">
	<a class="bookmark" title="vaccine-storage" name="vaccine-storage"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Vaccine Storage</h2>
	
	<p>All ASN providers are required to follow the <a title="TVFC storage and handling guidelines" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx">TVFC program storage and handling guidelines</a> at all times.  If a provider administers both ASN and TVFC vaccines, the ASN vaccines must be stored separately from the TVFC vaccines.</p>
	
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Mobile-Vaccination-Clinics">
	<a class="bookmark" title="mobile-vaccination-clinics" name="mobile-vaccination-clinics"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Mobile Vaccination Clinics</h2>
	
	<p>An ASN provider may conduct off-site, mobile vaccination clinics using ASN vaccines. However, the ASN eligibility still needs to be determined through the use of the <a title="Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#patient-eligibility">Adult Eligibility Screening Record (EF11-12842)</a> for all patients that receive the ASN vaccines at each visit.  Additionally, required vaccine storage and handling guidelines must be followed at all times and the vaccine must be returned to the original approved vaccine storage unit at the end of each day. Vaccines are extremely sensitive to temperature excursions.  Any exposure to out-of-range temperatures could make the vaccine non-viable.  For this reason, it is important to regularly monitor the temperature of the vaccines and take quick action when temperature excursions occur.  Please refer to the <a title="vaccine storage and handling page" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx#mass-vaccination">vaccine storage and handling page</a> of this website, for specific information regarding the transporting of vaccines for Mass Vaccination Clinics and handling temperature excursions.</p>

<div class="Section" id="Advertisement-of-ASN-Vaccine-by-Provider">
	<a class="bookmark" title="advertisement" name="advertisement"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Advertisement of ASN Vaccine by Provider</h2>
	
	<p>All ASN providers may advertise and promote the availability of ASN vaccines to eligible patients.</p>
	
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Reporting-Doses-Administered">
	<a class="bookmark" title="reporting" name="reporting"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Reporting Doses Administered</h2>
	
	<p>All ASN vaccine doses administered are to be reported as "19 and over" in EVI, under the "Doses" tab.  All ASN providers are required to accurately report all doses provided to adults. The TVFC Program uses this information to account for adult usage and to project and maintain supply.</p>

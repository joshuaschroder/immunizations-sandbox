		<h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>
		<p>Any child who is 18 years of age or younger and meets at least one of the eligibility criteria listed below is eligible to receive TVFC vaccine:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Enrolled in Medicaid, or is Medicaid-eligible</li>
			<li>Enrolled in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</li>
			<li>Is an American Indian, or Alaska Native (As defined by <a title="25 U.S.C. 1603 - Definitions" href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2011-title25/USCODE-2011-title25-chap18-other-sec1603/content-detail.html">25 U.S.C. 1603</a>)</li>
			<li>Is uninsured</li>
			<li>Is underinsured
				<ul>
					<li>A child who has commercial (private) health insurance, but coverage does not include vaccines</li>
					<li>A child whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (TVFC-eligible for non-covered vaccines only)</li>
					<li>A child whose insurance caps vaccine coverage at a certain amount.  Once that coverage amount is reached, the child is categorized as underinsured</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Insured children that have Medicaid as their secondary insurance (Medicaid-eligible) are eligible for TVFC vaccine and MUST NOT be refused vaccine administration due to their insurance status.</p>
		<p>Immigration status does not affect a child’s eligibility for the TVFC Program.  Immigrants should be offered the same immunization services that other children receive.</p>
		<p>If a child is TVFC-eligible in more than one eligibility category, the provider must select and document the eligibility category that will require the least out-of-pocket expense for the parent or guardian.</p>

		<h3>Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</h3>
		<p>Texas has an insurance program called the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  An agreement between the DSHS Immunization Unit and CHIP stipulates that vaccines for eligible CHIP enrollees are purchased through the federal contract.  Since children with CHIP are not eligible for the federal VFC Program, the DSHS Immunization Unit is reimbursed for doses administered to CHIP children based on CHIP enrollment data.  The Vaccine Purchase Estimator Tool (VPET) is a tool provided by the CDC which is used to estimate the number of vaccine doses required to fully vaccinate the state of Texas’ enrolled CHIP population with all applicable vaccines that are given quarterly.  Each TVFC provider who administers VFC vaccines to CHIP children are required to bill CHIP for the vaccine administration fees.  The CHIP pays the provider an administration fee and reimburses the DSHS Immunization Unit for the cost of the vaccines that were administered to CHIP children.</p>

		<h3>Medicaid as Secondary Insurance</h3>
		<p>If a child has private health insurance and Medicaid as secondary insurance, the child is TVFC-eligible.  The provider can administer TVFC vaccine to the child and bill Medicaid for the administration fee.  The parent or guardian of a child with Medicaid as secondary insurance should never be billed for a vaccine administration fee.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Nineteen-Year-Olds">
		<a class="bookmark" title="nineteen" name="nineteen"></a>
		<p>Patients who are 19 years of age and who previously initiated a vaccination series under the TVFC Program, but have not completed the series, may complete the series using vaccines provided through the ASN Program.  A participating ASN provider can administer the vaccines, regardless of the patient’s current health insurance status.  This provision only applies to patients that have not yet reached their 20th birthday.</p>

	<h2>Patient Eligibility Screening</h2>
	<p>Screening for patient eligibility is the foundation of provider-level accountability.  Screening all children at every immunization encounter and documenting eligibility screening at every visit is the only way to ensure that TVFC vaccine is used only for TVFC-eligible children.  As such, full compliance on screening for eligibility is required.  In the event proper screening is not done and this results in the administration of TVFC vaccine to a non-TVFC-eligible child, providers are responsible for replacing any TVFC vaccine with private stock.</p>
	<p>Providers are required to document the eligibility of each child receiving TVFC vaccine at every visit.  During a child’s initial visit to the provider site, the provider must document the child’s eligibility category per the TVFC Program guidelines and update the child’s eligibility information during each future visit.</p>
	<p>Providers may use the Patient Eligibility Screening Record or may electronically store patient demographic information.  A new Patient Eligibility Screening Record must be completed for all children at every visit, even including children with a previous record on file.  A child’s eligibility must be documented at every visit prior to vaccine administration.  The eligibility information must be easily retrievable.  The parent, guardian, or provider may complete the Patient Eligibility Screening Record.  Verification of parent/guardian response is not required.</p>
	<p>Documentation of eligibility screening must include the following elements:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Date of screening</li>
		<li>Child’s name</li>
		<li>Child’s date of birth</li>
		<li>Parent/Guardian’s name</li>
		<li>Clinic name</li>
		<li>Eligibility status for each visit</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The <a title="Patient Eligibility Screening Record" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#patient-eligibility">Patient Eligibility Screening Record (C-10)</a> must be kept on file with the patient’s record, by all providers, for a minimum of five years after the last date of service to the patient and must be easily retrievable.</p>
	<p>It is also acceptable for providers to utilize electronic medical records systems (EMRs) to capture and save the information from the Patient Eligibility Screening Records as long as the EMR captures all the required eligibility elements.</p>

		<h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>
		<p>Any child who is 18 years of age or younger and meets at least one of the eligibility criteria listed below is eligible to receive Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) vaccine:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Medicaid eligible</li>
			<li>Enrolled in Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the provider bills CHIP for the services</li>
			<li>Is an American Indian</li>
			<li>Is an Alaskan Native</li>
			<li>Does not have health insurance</li>
			<li>Is underinsured:
				<ul>
					<li>A child who has commercial (private) health insurance, but coverage does not include vaccines;</li>
					<li>A child whose insurance does not cover all ACIP recommended vaccines (TVFC-eligible for non-covered vaccines only); or</li>
					<li>A child whose insurance caps vaccine coverage at a certain amount. Once that coverage amount is reached, the child is categorized as underinsured.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Immigration status does not affect a client’s eligibility for TVFC. Immigrants should be offered the same immunization services that other clients receive in public health clinics.</p>
		<p>If a child younger than nineteen years of age loses access to his or her health insurance because of incarceration, the child is considered uninsured and TVFC eligible.</p>
		<p>Children who have private insurance that covers vaccines are not eligible to receive TVFC vaccines in public health department clinics, but instead will be referred to their medical home for immunizations. A local health department (LHD) that provides comprehensive healthcare services to children with private insurance may continue to serve as the medical home for their privately insured patients. However, TVFC requires that private stock vaccine be purchased to continue to vaccinate fully, privately insured children.</p>
		<p>American Indian and Alaskan Native children with private insurance are eligible for TVFC vaccine and MUST NOT be refused vaccine administration due to their insurance status.</p>
		<p>If a child is TVFC eligible in more than one eligibility category, the provider must select and document the eligibility category that will require the least out-of-pocket expense for the parent/guardian.</p>

		<h3>Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</h3>
		<p>TVFC providers who administer TVFC vaccines to CHIP children are required to bill CHIP for the vaccines administered. Because children with CHIP are not eligible for the federal VFC Program, the State must reimburse CDC for the cost of the vaccines used to immunize CHIP children. CHIP pays the provider for the administration fee and reimburses the DSHS Immunizations Unit for the cost of the vaccines that were administered to CHIP children. The DSHS Immunizations Unit uses these vaccine funds to replenish those doses that were administered to CHIP children.</p>

	<div class="SubSection" id="Medicaid">
		<a class="bookmark" title="medicaid" name="medicaid"></a>
		<h3>Medicaid as Secondary Insurance</h3>
		<p>If a child has private health insurance and Medicaid as secondary insurance, the child is TVFC eligible. The provider can administer TVFC vaccine to the child and bill Medicaid for the administration fee. The parent/guardian of a child with Medicaid as a secondary should never be billed for a vaccine administration fee.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="SubSection" id="Nineteen-Year-Olds">
		<a class="bookmark" title="nineteen" name="nineteen"></a>
		<p>Individuals who are 19 years of age and previously initiated a vaccination series under the TVFC Program, but have not completed the series, may complete the series using Adult Safety Net (ASN) vaccines, regardless of their current health insurance status. The vaccine must be administered by an ASN provider at a DSHS health service region or local health department clinic. This provision only applies to individuals that have not yet reached their 20th birthday.</p>

	<h2>Patient Eligibility Screening</h2>
	<p>Screening for eligibility is the foundation of provider-level accountability. Screening all children for and documenting eligibility at every visit is the only way to ensure that TVFC vaccine is used only for TVFC eligible patients. As such, anything less than full compliance is not allowable. The enrolled provider will have additional follow-up actions if found deficient.</p>
	<p>Providers must document the eligibility category of each client receiving TVFC vaccine in the patient’s chart or in an electronic data file. During a child’s initial visit to the provider site, the provider must document the child’s eligibility category per TVFC guidelines and update the child’s eligibility information during future visits. Documentation of eligibility screening must include the following elements:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Child’s name</li>
		<li>Child’s date of birth</li>
		<li>Parent/Guardian’s name</li>
		<li>Clinic name</li>
		<li>Date of screening</li>
		<li>Eligible status for each visit</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Providers may choose to use the <a title="Patient Eligibility Screening Record" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#patient-eligibility">Patient Eligibility Screening Record (C-10)</a> or electronically store eligibility screening information. The Patient Eligibility Screening Record provides a means of recording responses to TVFC eligibility questions. The parent, guardian, individual of record, or provider may complete this form. Verification of parent/guardian response is not required.</p>
	<p>For providers opting to use the Patient Eligibility Screening Record (C-10), the most current version of the Patient Eligibility Screening Record (rev. 03/2014) is to be completed for all patients, including patients with a prior version on file, and updated at every immunization visit.</p>
	<p>The eligibility information should be easily retrievable. The patient eligibility record must be maintained on file by the provider for a minimum of five years after the last date of service to the patient.</p>

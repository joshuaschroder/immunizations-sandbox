<p>As the complexity of immunizations and immunization related programs grow, TVFC Program participants may become more vulnerable to unintentionally committing acts that could be construed as fraud and/or abuse. A working understanding of what constitutes fraud and abuse is critical for all persons working in the TVFC Program. Fraud and abuse, whether intentional or not, is subject to all federal fraud and abuse laws.</p>

<div class="Section" id="Failure-to-Comply-with-TVFC-Requirements">
	<a class="bookmark" title="failure" name="failure"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Failure to Comply with TVFC Requirements</h2>
	<p>When providers enroll in the TVFC program, they agree to comply with all the requirements of the program. Lack of adherence to the TVFC program requirements by an enrolled provider could lead to fraud and abuse of the TVFC program by that provider. Non-compliance with program requirements may occur due to an unintentional lack of understanding of the TVFC program requirements or the behavior may be intentional. If the non-compliance appears intentional and the provider has received financial benefits from the behavior, the situation would require immediate referral for investigation of suspected TVFC fraud and abuse.</p>

	<a class="bookmark" title="prevention" name="prevention"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Fraud and Abuse Prevention</h2>
	<p>TVFC will actively work with enrolled providers to help prevent fraud and abuse in the TVFC program. The best methods to prevent fraud and abuse are strong educational components discussed during the provider enrollment process and during TVFC compliance visits. Both occasions provide the opportunity to identify and prevent situations that may develop into fraud and abuse.</p>

<div class="Section" id="Reporting-Fraud-and-Abuse">
	<a class="bookmark" title="reporting" name="reporting"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Reporting Fraud and Abuse</h2>
	<p>Suspected fraud or abuse can be reported to the <a title="DSHS Immunizations Unit" href="/immunize/tvfc/contact.aspx">DSHS Immunizations Unit</a>, DSHS health service regions or local health departments via email, telephone, fax, or letter. Furthermore, newspaper articles and internet pages that promote potential fraudulent situations are investigated. DSHS health service regions, local health departments, and other contractors must report all cases of alleged or suspected fraud or abuse. Reports received by the DSHS Immunizations Unit in any form that merit further investigation will be referred to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office.</p>

	<h2>About TVFC Fraud and Abuse</h2>
	<p>As the complexity of immunizations and immunization-related programs grow, TVFC providers may become more vulnerable to unintentionally committing acts that could be construed as fraud and/or abuse.  A working understanding of what constitutes fraud and abuse is critical for all persons working in the TVFC Program.  Fraud and abuse, whether intentional or not, is subject to all federal fraud and abuse laws.</p>

	<hr/>
	<h2>Failure to Comply with TVFC Requirements</h2>
	<p>When providers enroll in the TVFC Program, they agree to comply with all the requirements of the program.  Lack of adherence to the TVFC Program requirements by an enrolled provider could lead to fraud and abuse of the TVFC Program by that provider.  Non-compliance with the TVFC Program requirements may occur due to an unintentional lack of understanding of the requirements, or the behavior may be intentional.  If the non-compliance appears intentional and the provider has received financial benefits from the behavior, the situation results in immediate referral for investigation of suspected TVFC fraud and abuse.</p>

	<a class="bookmark" title="prevention" name="prevention"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Fraud and Abuse Prevention</h2>
	<p>The TVFC Program actively works with enrolled providers to help prevent fraud and abuse in the TVFC Program.  The best methods to prevent fraud and abuse are strong educational components discussed during the provider enrollment process and during the TVFC Compliance visits.  Both occasions provide the opportunity to identify and prevent situations that may develop into fraud and abuse.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Reporting-Fraud-and-Abuse">
	<a class="bookmark" title="reporting" name="reporting"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Reporting Fraud and Abuse</h2>
	<p>Suspected fraud or abuse can be reported to the <a title="Contact the TVFC Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/contact.aspx">TVFC Program</a> or the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) via email, telephone, fax, or letter.  Furthermore, newspaper articles and internet pages that promote potential fraudulent situations are investigated.  The responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) and DSHS quality assurance (QA) contractors must report all cases of alleged or suspected fraud or abuse.  Reports received by the DSHS Immunization Unit in any form that merit further investigation will be referred to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office.  The state Medicaid agency will conduct preliminary investigations and, as warranted, refer appropriate cases to the stateâ€™s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit following the Federal Regulatory scheme at <a title="42 CFR section 455.15" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=085fb3d32b9ee7428a83870116780aaf&mc=true&node=se42.4.455_115&rgn=div8">42 CFR section 455.15</a> and <a title="42 CFR section 455.23" href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=085fb3d32b9ee7428a83870116780aaf&mc=true&node=se42.4.455_123&rgn=div8">42 CFR section 455.23</a>.</p>

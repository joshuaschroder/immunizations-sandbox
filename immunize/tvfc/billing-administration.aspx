<h2>Billing for Vaccine</h2>

<p>Providers who are enrolled in the Texas Vaccines for Children (TVFC) Program are prohibited from charging any TVFC-eligible child for the cost of vaccines.  Vaccines are provided at no cost to the provider in order to vaccinate eligible children.  Charging for the cost of vaccines supplied by the TVFC Program constitutes fraudulent behavior.  <a title="Fraud in the TVFC Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/fraud-abuse.aspx">Fraud in the TVFC Program</a> will be handled in the same manner as Medicaid fraud.</p>

<p>Private providers may not refer a <a title="TVFC-eligible child" href="/immunize/tvfc/patient-eligibility.aspx">TVFC-eligible child</a> to another health care provider for immunizations if the provider has already accepted that child into the practice as their patient, unless directed by DSHS.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Administration Fees</h2>

<p>Providers are required to enroll in the TVFC Program to obtain vaccines at no cost in order to vaccinate TVFC-eligible children, including Medicaid and CHIP children.  The TVFC provider may charge an administration fee for administering vaccine to TVFC-eligible children.  The maximum administration fee that a provider may charge is <strong>$14.85</strong> per dose.</p>

<p>Children (0-18 years of age) who are enrolled in Medicaid as their secondary insurance are eligible to receive TVFC vaccines.  As stated in the Medicaid Provider Manual, providers should bill their usual and customary fee except for vaccines obtained from the TVFC Program.</p>

<p>Providers may not charge Medicaid patients for the vaccine received from the TVFC Program. Providers may charge a usual and customary fee not to exceed <strong>$14.85</strong> for vaccine administration when providing immunizations to a patient eligible for the TVFC vaccines.</p>

<p>Providers are reimbursed the lesser of the billed amount or the maximum allowable fee.</p>

<p>As stated in the CDC Vaccines for Children (VFC) Operations Guide, the state Medicaid agency may have the discretion to pay an administration fee up to the regional maximum amount.  A provider must not charge a vaccine administration fee to non-Medicaid VFC-eligible children that exceeds the administration fee cap of <strong>$14.85 </strong>per dose.  For Medicaid VFC-eligible children, the provider must accept the reimbursement for immunization administration set by the state Medicaid agency or the contracted Medicaid health plans.</p>

<p>For more information on Medicaid reimbursement, please refer to the <a title="Texas Medicaid Provider Manual" href="http://www.tmhp.com/Pages/Medicaid/Medicaid_Publications_Provider_manual.aspx">Texas Medicaid Provider Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Children (0-18 years of age) who are enrolled in CHIP are eligible to receive TVFC vaccines, however TVFC providers must bill CHIP for the administration of a vaccine to a CHIP-enrolled child. For more information on CHIP reimbursement, please refer to the <a title="Texas CHIP Provider Manual" href="http://www.texaschildrenshealthplan.org/sites/default/files/Provider%20Manual.pdf">Texas CHIP Provider Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Vaccines are required to be administered to all TVFC-eligible children and service cannot be denied due to the parent’s or guardian’s inability to pay the administration fee.  A TVFC provider may not send a parent or guardian to collections.  <strong><em>A TFVC provider may not charge penalties for the inability to pay administration fees</em></strong>.</p>

<p>For additional information on the Vaccines for Children (VFC) statutory requirements for the VFC Program regarding the vaccine administration fee, please see the <a title="CDC's Information for VFC Providers page" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/providers/index.html">CDC's Information for VFC Providers page</a>.</p>

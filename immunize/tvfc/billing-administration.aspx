<h2>Billing for Vaccine</h2>
<p>Providers enrolled in the TVFC Program are prohibited from charging eligible patients, Medicaid, CHIP, or other entities for the cost of vaccine. The vaccine is provided at no cost to the provider to vaccinate eligible children. Charging for the cost of vaccine supplied by TVFC constitutes fraudulent behavior. <a title="Fraud in the TVFC Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/fraud-abuse.aspx">Fraud in the TVFC Program</a> will be handled in the same manner as Medicaid fraud.</p>
<p>Private providers may not refer a <a title="TVFC-eligible child" href="/immunize/tvfc/patient-eligibility.aspx">TVFC-eligible child</a> to another health-care provider for immunizations if the provider has already accepted that child into the practice as their patient, unless directed by DSHS.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Administration Fees</h2>
<p>Providers may charge an administration fee for administering vaccine to TVFC-eligible children. The maximum fee a provider may charge for administration is $14.85 per vaccine. Vaccines are required to be administered even if the patient/guardian/parent is unable to pay the administration fee.</p>
<p>Providers may not send a patient/guardian/parent to collections or charge fees for the patient's inability to pay administration fees.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Medicaid and CHIP Clients</h2>
<p>Medicaid and CHIP patients must not be charged any fees for vaccine or for vaccine administration. Medicaid and CHIP will reimburse providers for administration fees. Providers are required to <a title="enroll in the TVFC Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/provider-enrollment.aspx">enroll in the TVFC Program</a> to obtain vaccine at no cost to vaccinate Medicaid and CHIP patients because Medicaid and CHIP will not reimburse providers for the cost of routinely recommended childhood vaccines. TVFC providers who administer vaccines to CHIP children are required to bill CHIP for the vaccines administered.</p>

	<h2>Refrigerator and Freezer Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Providers are required to have appropriate equipment that can store vaccine and maintain proper conditions. Two types of storage units are acceptable for storage: a refrigerator that has a separate freezer compartment with a separate exterior door or a stand-alone, single-purpose refrigerator or freezer. CDC strongly recommends stand-alone freezers and refrigerators without freezers for vaccine storage. A frost-free or automatic defrost unit is preferred</li>
		<li>Combination units, if used, must have separate thermostats for the refrigerator and freezer compartments.</li>
		<li>Small combination refrigerator-freezer units outfitted with a single external door and dorm-style refrigerators are never allowed for the storage of TVFC vaccine.</li>
		<li>High volume clinics may find separate refrigerators and freezers useful. A standard side-by-side or top-freezer unit is sufficient. Frost-free freezers are preferred. There are small, stand-alone freezers specifically manufactured to maintain very cold temperatures; these freezers are acceptable for the storage of varicella, MMRV, or MMR only.</li>
		<li>The refrigerator compartment is to maintain temperatures between 36&#176;F and 46&#176;F (2&#176;C and 8&#176;C) for vaccine viability. The refrigerator temperature should be set at midrange, 40&#176;F (5&#176;C). The freezer compartment should maintain temperatures between -58&#176;F and +5&#176;F (-50&#176;C and -15&#176;C). An alarm system and back-up generator are recommended to help reduce vaccine loss when unexpected temperature fluctuations occur.</li>
		<li>Water bottles and frozen coolant packs will help maintain stable temperatures with frequent opening and closing of unit doors, in the event of a power failure, and serve as a physical barrier to placing vaccines in an area where there is greater risk for temperature excursions. Place water bottles (labeled "Not for consumption") on the top shelf, floor, and in door racks of the refrigerator. Place frozen coolant packs along walls, back, and bottom of freezer and inside the door racks. Diluents may be stored in the door of the refrigerator and can provide extra insulation much like bottles of water. Place items in unit doors carefully so they cannot dislodge, and prevent doors from closing or weighing them down so much that seals are not tight. Placing bottles of water in the lower bins of the refrigerator is also helpful as this space cannot be used for vaccine storage.</li>
		<li>Depending on the size of the unit, the amount of vaccine stored, and the time of year, "sufficient" may differ from one clinic to the other. However, there should be adequate water bottles in each refrigerator and adequate ice packs in each freezer to help maintain proper storage temperature during peak usage of the unit or until vaccine can be moved to another refrigerator or freezer. Gel packs are only allowed for use in the freezer.</li>
		<li>If a refrigerator or freezer is new or newly repaired, allow a week of refrigerator and freezer temperature readings/recordings (a minimum of two times each workday) including minimum/maximum temperatures one time each morning to make sure temperatures are within appropriate ranges before using the unit to store vaccines. Read the refrigerator and freezer instructions carefully before adjusting the temperature control settings, and then make sure temperatures do not change overnight. Some manufacturers recommend resetting the controls in the summer and winter. If so, post instructions on the refrigerator door.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Refrigerator/freezer units must be large enough to hold the yearâ€™s largest inventory.</li>
		<li>All TVFC providers should identify sufficient alternative space to store vaccines and maintain the cold chain during any period when the refrigerator or freezer is out of service.</li>
		<li>Refrigerators and freezers that store TVFC vaccine are to be dedicated to storing vaccine only. Food or drinks in the same refrigerator or freezer as vaccine is not acceptable.</li>
		<li>A <a title="Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)</a> is required to be located on or near all units that store TVFC vaccine. Freezer/refrigerator temperatures are required to be checked, recorded and initialed twice daily.</li>
		<li>Refrigerators and freezers storing vaccine should be plugged directly into a wall outlet with a plug guard. Multi-strip outlets must not be used.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Thermometer-Requirements">
	<a class="bookmark" title="thermometer" name="thermometer"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Thermometer Requirements</h2>
	<p>Refrigerators and freezers that store TVFC vaccine must contain a centrally located thermometer with a current certificate of calibration. The thermometer probe should be placed as close to the vaccine as possible. Thermometers may be supplied by the TVFC Program when funding allows; however, it is the responsibility of the provider to ensure they have a thermometer accompanied by a current certificate of calibration in each refrigerator and freezer that stores TVFC vaccine. A valid certificate of calibration matching the serial number of the thermometer in use is to be posted on the refrigerator.</p>
	<p>Each thermometer must be covered by a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration. Figure 3-2 below presents an example of a valid certificate of calibration. The traceability declaration is to confirm the measurement standards and instruments used during calibration of the product are traceable to an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited testing laboratory, to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or to another internationally recognized standards agency. The accompanying certificate should be retained as proof of certification. The certificate is valid for two years from the date of calibration or the date of expiration, whichever occurs first. A continuous-read temperature-recording device does not replace the requirement for a certified thermometer.</p>
	<p>All certificates of calibration must contain:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Model number</li>
		<li>Serial number</li>
		<li>Date of calibration</li>
		<li>Measurement results that indicate unit passed the test and the documented uncertainty is within suitable limits. <br/>(recommended uncertainty = +/-1&#176;F (0.5&#176;C))</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Figure 3-2: Example of a Valid Certified Thermometer Certificate</strong><br/>
		<img src="img/certified-thermometer-certificate.jpg" alt="Example of a Valid Certified Thermometer Certificate" title="Example of a Valid Certified Thermometer Certificate" style="margin-left:25px; border:1px solid #000;"/>
	</p>
	<p>Certified calibrated thermometers for use in any refrigerator/freezer unit with TVFC vaccine should include the following functions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Current temperature, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures and</li>
		<li>Detachable temperature probe in bio-safe glycol filled glass bottle or a similar temperature buffered probe rather than measurement by ambient air temperatures.		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Refrigerators and freezers that are manufactured with built-in temperature monitoring capability are required to be accompanied by a certificate of calibration for the thermometer.</p>
	<p>The temperature probe in the unit needs to be centrally located, and the temperature thermostat is to be capable of being adjusted by the provider as needed to maintain proper temperature.</p>
	<p>The TVFC Program requires the use of a digital thermometer with a biosafe glycol-encased probe that measures liquid temperature. Additionally, it is recommended that the temperature monitor is placed on the outside of the unit door to allow for reading temperatures without opening the unit door.</p>
	<p>All TVFC enrolled providers are recommended to have at least one back-up thermometer with a current certificate of calibration on hand (not stored in unit alongside current thermometer) for use when a thermometer in a storage unit unexpectedly stops working or when the thermometer needs to be sent for re-calibration.</p>
	<p>The TVFC Program also recommends that providers utilize data loggers. A data logger provides more accurate and comprehensive monitoring of temperature excursions to which vaccines may be exposed. Data loggers, if used, must be accompanied by a current certificate of calibration. If a digital data logger is used, it must have the following capabilities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Detachable probe (kept in the glycol-filled bottle)</li>
		<li>Alarm for out-of-range temperatures</li>
		<li>Current temperature, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures</li>
		<li>Reset button</li>
		<li>Low battery indicator</li>
		<li>Accuracy of +/- 1&#176;F (0.5&#176;C)</li>
		<li>Memory storage of at least 4,000 readings (device will not rewrite over old data and stops recording when memory is full)</li>
		<li>User-programmable logging interval (or reading rate)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Providers must also have a room thermometer to record the room temperature when a temperature excursion occurs in a vaccine storage unit.</p>

	<hr/>
	<h2>Vaccines</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Some vaccines are sensitive to light; vaccine efficacy could be compromised if exposed to the light. Providers should safeguard the following vaccines from light: MMR, MMRV, HPV, MCV4, some Hib vaccines, rotavirus, and varicella.</li>
		<li>All vaccines are to be stored in the refrigerator and should never be frozen. The exceptions are varicella, MMR, and MMRV.</li>
		<li>All vaccines should be stored in the central area of the refrigerator/freezer shelves, not in the vegetable bins, meat drawer, or in the door. Storing vaccine in the central body of the refrigerator/freezer helps maintain vaccine at proper temperatures.</li>
		<li>Vaccines should be stored and/or stacked to allow cold air to circulate freely.</li>
		<li>TVFC vaccines must be stored separately from privately purchased vaccine. Public and private stocks should be labeled accordingly.</li>
		<li>TVFC supplied vaccine may be stored in a "blended manner". Providers do not have to separate public vaccines based on funding source (e.g., VFC, 317, CHIP, and State funds).</li>
		<li>TVFC providers enrolled in the <a title="ASN Program" href="/immunize/tvfc/tvfc-asn.aspx">ASN Program</a> must separate public pediatric doses from public adult doses.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Protective-Equipment">
	<a class="bookmark" title="protective-equipment" name="protective-equipment"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Protective Equipment</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The power supply for vaccine storage units must be protected.</li>
		<li>Plug guards are required to be used on all refrigerators/freezers that store TVFC vaccines. Plug guards are effective tools in preventing the accidental unplugging of equipment. If a plug guard will not fit then tape the appliance cord to the wall and post on the wall nearby a sign stating "Do Not Unplug." DSHS health service regions, local health departments, and quality assurance contractors are responsible for providing plug guards to providers.</li>
		<li>A "Do Not Unplug" sign is required to be posted on or near all outlets of refrigerators/freezers used for storing vaccine.</li>
		<li>A "Do Not Disconnect" sign must be posted by each circuit breaker.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Personnel">
	<a class="bookmark" title="personnel" name="personnel"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Personnel</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Vaccine viability depends on the knowledge and habits of the clinic staff. All staff who handle TVFC vaccine should be trained on proper storage, handling, and administration of vaccine. The facility is required to designate a primary and at least one back-up vaccine coordinator to ensure that TVFC vaccines are handled and stored properly. Both employees are required to complete the mandatory "You Call the Shots" training modules annually.</li>
		<li>All staff that handles TVFC vaccine is to be aware of and familiar with the written procedures for emergency situations to assure continued viability of the vaccines.</li>
		<li>New employees must be adequately trained regarding the proper storage and handling of vaccine prior to administering TVFC vaccine.</li>
		<li>The DSHS Immunizations Unit has developed the <a title="Texas Vaccine Education Online" href="http://www.vaccineeducationonline.org/">Texas Vaccine Education Online</a> to provide short online training courses on topics related to vaccines. After enrolling online, individuals may log in and take any course free of charge.

	<a class="bookmark" title="storage-handling-plan" name="storage-handling-plan"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Routine and Emergency Storage and Handling Plan</h2>
<p>TVFC providers must have plans for routine and emergency vaccine management. The TVFC Program provides templates for the Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan and the Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (both included in <a title="Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan and the Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">E11-11190</a>). Providers are not required to use these templates, but they are valuable tools available to providers should they need assistance in developing an emergency plan. If the templates are not used, providers must develop routine and emergency vaccine management plans that include all of the information on the templates provided by the TVFC Program.</p>
	<p>The Routine Storage and Handling Plan and the Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan must be reviewed and updated annually. A review date is required on all plans in order to verify that they are current. All plans must include the signature, name, and title of the preparer of the documents.</p>
	<p>TVFC providers will be asked to provide a copy of their routine and emergency vaccine storage and handling plans at <a title="VFC Compliance Visits" href="/immunize/tvfc/site-visits.aspx">VFC Compliance Visits</a>. The plans should be posted on or near the refrigerator or freezer containing TVFC vaccine. Make sure all employees involved with vaccine management are aware of this plan.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Vaccine-Protection">
	<a class="bookmark" title="vaccine-protection" name="vaccine-protection"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Vaccine Protection in the Event of an Emergency</h2>
	<p>As noted above, every facility maintaining an inventory of state-provided vaccine is required to develop and display an <a title="Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (E11-11190)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (E11-11190)</a> in the event of emergencies that could result in the loss of vaccine.</p>
	<p>In the event of an emergency, contact your responsible entity (DSHS health service region or local health department) to inform them of the situation. Be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The temperature of the vaccine</li>
		<li>The amount of vaccine</li>
		<li>Expiration dates</li>
		<li>How long the vaccine was exposed to inappropriate temperatures</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following items must be addressed in the Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Identify a responsible person and a responsible back up person to enact the contingency plan. Be sure to include contact information such as home, office, and cell phone numbers for each. Contact information should be updated annually.</li>
		<li>Identify an alternative location to take the TVFC provided vaccine for storage. A location with a power generator or other alternate source of power such as a hospital or grocery store is preferable. Ideally, this facility should be located within a reasonable distance from your clinic. Be sure to contact the alternate location for their approval before including them on your plan and list their contact person(s) and phone number(s) on your plan.</li>
		<li>Specify the steps to transport vaccine to the alternate location. Steps should include:
			<ol>
				<li>Noting the time of the emergency situation/power outage.</li>
				<li>Noting the temperature of the refrigerator and freezer before removing any vaccine for transportation.</li>
				<li>Indicating what containers will be used and how the refrigerated vaccine should be packed for transportation (i.e., conditioned ice packs separated from the vaccine by plastic bubble wrap or crumpled paper to prevent freezing and damage).</li>
				<li>Taking inventory of the vaccine as you move it into the transport container, being careful to indicate the number of doses of each vaccine and the expiration dates.</li>
				<li>Keeping a certified and calibrated thermometer in the transport container and noting the time and temperature when you place the vaccine in the alternate storage. This reveals how long the vaccine was at less-than-ideal temperature.				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>

<div class="Section" id="Cold-Chain">
	<a class="bookmark" title="cold-chain" name="cold-chain"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Cold Chain Management and Vaccine Transport</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>TVFC requires vaccines to be stored properly from the time they are manufactured until the time they are administered. The system used to maintain and distribute vaccines in optimal condition is called the cold chain.</li>
		<li>All TVFC providers must identify sufficient alternative space to store vaccines and maintain the cold chain during any period when the refrigerator or freezer is out of service. Enough proper supplies for packing and transporting the entire provider vaccine supply/inventory needs to be available in case of an emergency.</li>
		<li>Providers must complete routine and emergency vaccine storage and handling plans. These documents must be reviewed and updated annually. The <em>Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan </em>and the <em>Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan</em> must be posted on or near the refrigerator or freezer that contains TVFC vaccine. Staff members are required to be aware of the emergency plan and be able to follow it in case of an emergency.</li>
		<li>Avoid prolonged temperature extremes by using transport containers containing vaccine inside vehicles and taking the quickest route possible. Do not leave vaccine unattended in vehicles. Do not place vaccine in the trunk of a vehicle.	</li>
		<li>Pack refrigerated vaccine first. Following the steps below will help maintain the cold chain during transport of refrigerated and frozen vaccines.</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<h3>Refrigerated Vaccine Transport</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Assemble Packing Supplies
			<ul>
				<li>Cooler. CDC recommends transport with a portable refrigerator unit. If this type of unit is not available, a hard-sided insulated cooler with at least 2-inch walls may be used if it can maintain the recommended temperature range (between 36&#176;F and 46&#176;F). Label the container with facility name and "Fragile Vaccines â€“ Do Not Freeze" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit.</li>
				<li>Cold packs. Do not use dry ice. Cold packs that are frozen need to be "conditioned" by leaving them at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until the edges have defrosted and the packs look like they have been "sweating". Frozen coolant packs that are not "conditionedâ€™ can freeze vaccine.</li>
				<li>Thermometer. Use a certified and calibrated thermometer (preferably with a biosafe glycol encased thermometer probe). Prepare the thermometer by placing it in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before packing the vaccine.</li>
				<li>Packing material. Use two 2-inch layers of bubble wrap or crumpled paper between each layer of ice packs and vaccine as well as at the top of the cooler. Not using enough bubble wrap/crumpled paper can cause the vaccine to freeze.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Spread a layer of conditioned cold packs (at least 2 inches) to cover the bottom of the cooler.</li>
		<li>Completely cover the conditioned cold packs with a 2-inch layer of bubble wrap/crumpled paper.</li>
		<li>Stack layers of vaccine boxes on the bubble wrap/crumpled paper. Do not let boxes of vaccine touch the cold packs.</li>
		<li>Place the thermometer/probe next to vaccines on top of the bubble wrap.</li>
		<li>Completely cover the vaccine with another 2-inch layer of bubble wrap/crumpled paper.</li>
		<li>Spread conditioned cold packs to cover the bubble wrap/crumpled paper. Make sure the cold packs do not touch the boxes of vaccine.</li>
		<li>Fill the cooler to the top with bubble wrap/crumpled paper. Place the thermometerâ€™s digital display on top of the bubble wrap/crumpled paper. Include a list of the vaccines that are stored in the container. Secure the lid to the cooler.</li>
		<li>Use a <a title="Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)</a> to record the temperature inside of the storage unit at the time the vaccines are removed, as well as the time. Also record the temperature of the transport container on the Temperature Recording Form. If vaccines are kept in a transport container for longer than an hour, record the temperatures hourly.</li>
		<li>As soon as you reach the destination site, check and record the vaccine temperature. If the vaccine is:
			<ul>
				<li>Between 36&#176;F and 46&#176;F, place it in the refrigerator.</li>
				<li>Below 36&#176;F or above 46&#176;F, label the vaccine "Do Not Use," place it in the refrigerator, and immediately contact your responsible entity.</li>
			</ul>
			Note: Always keep vaccine properly stored until otherwise instructed by a State pharmacist or the vaccine manufacturer.
		</li>		
	</ol>
	<br/>
	<h3>Frozen Vaccine Transport in an Emergency Situation</h3>
	<p>Varicella-containing vaccines are fragile! The CDC and the vaccine manufacturer do not recommend transporting varicella-containing vaccines. If these vaccines need to be relocated in an emergency situation, the following steps must be taken.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Assemble Packing Supplies
			<ul>
				<li>Portable Freezer. The CDC recommends transport with a portable freezer unit that maintains the temperature between -58&#176;F and +5&#176;F (-50&#176;C and -15&#176;C). Portable freezers may be available for rent in some places. Label the portable freezer with facility name and "Fragile Vaccines â€“ Keep Frozen" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit.</li>
				<li>Thermometer. Use a certified and calibrated thermometer (preferably with a biosafe glycol encased thermometer probe). Prepare the thermometer by placing it in the portable freezer unit at least 2 hours before packing the vaccine.</li>
				<li>Cooler (if portable freezer is unavailable). If a portable freezer is unavailable, a hard-sided insulated cooler with at least 2-inch walls may be used if it can maintain the temperature between -58&#176;F and +5&#176;F (-50&#176;C and -15&#176;C). Label the container with facility name and "Fragile Vaccines â€“ Keep Frozen" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit.</li>
				<li>Coolant packs (if portable freezer is unavailable). Do not use dry ice. Coolant packs should be frozen.</li>
				<li>Dry ice is not allowed to be used for transporting vaccines, even for temporary storage or emergency transport. Dry ice may subject vaccine to temperatures colder than -58&#176;F (-50&#176;C).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If a portable freezer is not available and a cooler must be used, follow the packing instructions for transporting refrigerated vaccine. Ensure that the coolant packs used in the cooler are frozen.</li>
		<li>Place a calibrated thermometer in the container used for transport as close as possible to the vaccine.</li>
		<li>Use a <a title="Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording Form (EC-105)</a> to record the temperature inside of the storage unit at the time the vaccines are removed, as well as the time. Also record the temperature of the transport container on the Temperature Recording Form.</li>
		<li>Continually monitor the vaccine temperature.</li>
		<li>Place the vaccine in the freezer immediately upon arrival at the alternate storage facility.</li>
		<li>Document the time the vaccine was removed from the transport container and temperature of the transport container and placed in the alternate storage unit.</li>
		<li>Immediately contact the manufacturer for stability data and guidance any time frozen vaccine has been exposed to a temperature above +5&#176;F. Do not discard the vaccine without contacting the manufacturer. Viability determination will be made on case by case basis. Contact your responsible entity with the viability determination from the manufacturer.		</li>

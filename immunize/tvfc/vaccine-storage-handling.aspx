	<h2>Refrigerator and Freezer Requirements</h2>
	<p>TVFC providers are required to have appropriate equipment that can store vaccine and maintain proper conditions:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Refrigerator and freezer units must be large enough to hold the year's largest inventory without crowding.</li>
		<li>The CDC recommends stand-alone refrigerators without freezers for vaccine storage.  Two types of refrigerator units are acceptable for storage: a stand-alone, single-purpose refrigerator or a pharmaceutical/purpose-built unit.</li>
		<li>The CDC recommends stand-alone freezers specifically manufactured to maintain very cold temperatures.  These freezers are acceptable for the storage of Varicella, MMRV, or MMR vaccines only.  A frost-free unit with an automatic defrost cycle is preferred.</li>
		<li>Combination units, if used, must have separate thermostats for the refrigerator and freezer compartments.  When using a combination refrigerator and freezer unit, the CDC recommends not using the freezer section of the dual unit to store frozen vaccines.  A separate stand-alone freezer unit is recommended by the CDC to store all frozen vaccines.</li>
		<li>Dorm-style and small combination refrigerator and freezer units outfitted with a single external door are never allowed for the storage of TVFC vaccine.</li>
		<li>The refrigerator compartment must maintain temperatures between 36&#176;F and 46&#176;F (2&#176;C and 8&#176;C) for vaccine viability.  The refrigerator temperature must be set at midrange, 40&#176;F (4&#176;C). </li>
		<li>The freezer compartment must maintain temperatures between -58&#176;F and +5&#176;F (-50&#176;C and -15&#176;C) for vaccine viability.</li>
		<li>An alarm system and back-up generator are recommended to help reduce vaccine loss when unexpected temperature fluctuations occur.</li>
		<li>Refrigerators and freezers storing vaccines must be plugged directly into a wall outlet with a plug guard.  Multi-strip outlets must not be used.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Each refrigerator or freezer must contain a sufficient number of water bottles to help maintain proper storage temperature during peak usage of the unit.  Peak usage is considered when there is frequent opening and closing of unit doors or a power failure.  Water bottles serve as a physical barrier to prevent placing vaccines in areas where there is greater risk for temperature excursions.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>For the Refrigerator</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure the refrigerator door is closed completely.</li>
		<li>Replace crisper bins with water bottles to help maintain consistent temperature.</li>
		<li>Label water bottles "Do Not Drink".</li>
		<li>Post "Do Not Unplug" signs on the refrigerator and by the electrical outlet.</li>
		<li>Place water bottles in unit doors carefully so they cannot dislodge, and prevent the doors from closing, or weighing down the door so much that it does not seal tightly.</li>
		<li>Place water bottles on the top shelf of the refrigerator.</li>
		<li>Do not use the top shelf for vaccine storage.</li>
		<li>Do not put food or beverages in the refrigerator.</li>
		<li>Do not put vaccines or diluent in the doors or floor of the refrigerator.</li>
		<li>Do not drink from or remove the water bottles.</li>
		<li>Leave 2-3 inches between all vaccine and the refrigerator walls.</li>
		<li>Store each type of vaccine or diluent in a separate container.</li>
		<li>Place vaccines with the earliest expiration dates in front of those with later expiration dates.</li>
		<li>Whenever possible, store diluent with the corresponding refrigerated vaccine.</li>
		<li>Attach labels to shelves and containers to clearly identify where each type of vaccine and diluent is stored.  If diluent is stored separately from the corresponding vaccine, label the container where it is stored.</li>
		<li>Store vaccines and diluents with similar packaging or names (e.g., DTaP and Tdap or Hib and HepB) or with both pediatric and adult formulations on different shelves to minimize the risk of administration errors.</li>
		<li>Make sure to label the formulation "pediatric" or "adult," if applicable.</li>
		<li>Always store vaccines in their original packaging with lids closed until ready for administration.</li>
		<li>Never store loose vials or manufacturer-filled syringes outside of their packaging.</li>
		<li>Do not pack a storage unit too tightly. This can restrict air circulation and impact vaccine temperature.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>For the Freezer</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure the freezer door is closed completely.</li>
		<li>Use frozen water bottles to help maintain consistent temperature.</li>
		<li>Place water bottles against the walls, in the back, on the floor, and in the door racks.</li>
		<li>Place water bottles carefully so they cannot dislodge, preventing the door from closing securely or weighing the door down so the seals are not tight.</li>
		<li>Post "Do Not Unplug" signs on the freezer and by the electrical outlet.</li>
		<li>Do not put food in the freezer.</li>
		<li>Leave 2-3 inches between all vaccines and the freezer walls.</li>
		<li>Do not store vaccines in the freezer doors.</li>
		<li>Avoid storing vaccines in any part of the unit that may not provide stable temperatures or sufficient air flow, such as directly under cooling vents or shelves on the door.</li>
		<li>Arrange vaccines in rows, allowing space between rows to promote air circulation.</li>
		<li>Store each type of vaccine in a separate container.</li>
		<li>Place vaccines with the earliest expiration dates in front of those with later expiration dates.</li>
		<li>Attach labels to shelves and containers to clearly identify where each type of vaccine is stored.</li>
		<li>Store vaccines with similar packaging or names (e.g., VAR and HZV) or with both pediatric and adult formulations on different shelves to minimize the risk of administration errors.</li>
		<li>Make sure to label the formulation "pediatric" or "adult," if applicable.</li>
		<li>Always store vaccines in their original packaging with lids closed until ready for administration.</li>
		<li>Never store loose vials or manufacturer-filled syringes outside of their packaging.</li>
		<li>Do not pack a storage unit too tightly.  This can restrict air circulation and impact vaccine temperature.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Depending on the size of the unit, the amount of vaccine stored, and the time of year, "sufficient" may differ from one clinic to the other.  However, there must be adequate water bottles in each refrigerator and adequate frozen water bottles in each freezer to help maintain proper storage temperature during peak usage of the unit or until vaccines can be moved to another refrigerator or freezer.</p>
	
	<p>Prior to using a new or newly repaired unit to store vaccines, allow 10 business days of refrigerator or freezer temperature readings/recordings (a minimum of two times each workday) on an <a title="TVFC Publications Page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">EC-105 form</a>.  Also record the required minimum/maximum temperatures one time each morning to ensure temperatures are within appropriate ranges.  Submit the recordings to the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) for review and approval, before placing vaccine in the storage unit.</p>
	
	<p>Read the refrigerator and freezer instructions carefully before adjusting the temperature control settings and then verify that the temperatures did not change overnight.  Some manufacturers recommend resetting the controls in the summer and winter.  If so, post instructions on the refrigerator door.</p>
	
	<p>Refrigerators and freezers that store TVFC vaccines are to be dedicated to storing vaccine only.  Food or drinks in the same refrigerator or freezer as vaccines is not allowed.  If other biologics must be stored in the same unit, store them below the vaccines to avoid contamination.</p>
	
	<p>Maintaining TVFC temperature logging requirements are mandatory for all TVFC providers:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A <a title="TVFC Publications Page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Temperature Recording form (EC-105)</a> is required to be located on or near all units that store TVFC vaccines.  Freezer and/or refrigerator temperatures are required to be checked, recorded and initialed twice daily</li>
		<li>Minimum and Maximum temperature readings must be cleared from the day before at the beginning of the business day</li>
		<li>Minimum and Maximum temperatures must also be recorded on the Temperature Recording Form once at the beginning of each business day</li>
		<li>Temperatures must be recorded manually on Temperature Recording Forms, even if using a digital data logger</li>
		<li>Temperature Recording Forms must be posted on each vaccine storage unit door or nearby in a readily accessible and visible location</li>
		<li>Temperature Recording Forms must be maintained for five years and made easily available</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If any out-of-range temperature excursion is observed, the TVFC provider must document all excursions and take the following actions immediately:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Place vaccines in a Vaccine Quarantine Bag and label vaccines as “DO NOT USE”;</li>
		<li>Store vaccines in a unit where they can be kept under appropriate conditions;</li>
		<li>Contact the vaccine manufacturer, to obtain documentation for the viability of the vaccine; and</li>
		<li>Contact the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) to report the manufacturer’s vaccine viability determination and complete the Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record attached to the Temperature Recording Form.</li>
	</ul>
	
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Thermometer-Requirements">
	<a class="bookmark" title="thermometer" name="thermometer"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Data Logger and Thermometer Requirements</h2>
	
	<p>Refrigerators and freezers that store TVFC vaccines must contain a centrally located data logger or thermometer with a current certificate of calibration.</p>
	
	<p>The TVFC Program and the CDC recommend the use of a continuous monitoring and recording digital data logger with a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing (also known as a Report of Calibration), set at a minimum recording interval of at least every 30 minutes.</p>
	
	<p>A data logger provides more accurate and comprehensive monitoring of temperature excursions to which vaccines may be exposed.  Data loggers, if used, must be accompanied by a current certificate of calibration.  A TVFC provider using data loggers must still comply with twice daily temperature and Minimum and Maximum recording requirements, as stated above.</p>
	
	<p>If a digital data logger is used, it must have the following capabilities:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Alarm for out-of-range temperatures</li>
		<li>Current temperature, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures</li>
		<li>Reset button</li>
		<li>Low battery indicator</li>
		<li>Accuracy of &#177;1&#176;F (&#177;0.5&#176;C)</li>
		<li>Memory storage of at least 4,000 readings (device will not rewrite over old data and stops recording when memory is full)</li>
		<li>User-programmable logging interval (or reading rate)</li>
		<li>Detachable probe (kept in the glycol-filled bottle)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Probes should be placed in buffered material so that they measure temperatures that are more representative of the temperature of the vaccine in the vial rather than the air temperature of the storage unit.  Examples of buffers include:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A vial filled with liquid (Example: glycol, ethanol, glycerin)</li>
		<li>A vial filled with loose media (Example: sand, glass beads)</li>
		<li>A solid block of material (Example: Teflon&#174;, aluminum)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The TVFC Program does not allow the following temperature monitoring devices:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Fluid-filled bio-safe liquid temperature monitoring devices</li>
		<li>Bi-metal stem temperature monitoring devices</li>
		<li>Food temperature monitoring devices</li>
		<li>Household mercury temperature monitoring devices</li>
		<li>Chart recorders</li>
		<li>Infrared temperature monitoring devices</li>
		<li>Temperature monitoring devices that are not calibrated</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These devices can have significant limitations, can be difficult to read and most only provide information on the temperature at the precise time they are read.  Therefore, temperature fluctuations outside the recommended range may not be detected.</p>
	<p>The data logger or thermometer probe must be placed as close to the vaccine as possible. Data-logger or thermometer probes must be:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Placed in the main body of the storage unit, away from walls, ceilings, cooling vents, doors, floor, and back of the unit</li>
		<li>Located in a central location of the unit near where the vaccine is stored</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> In pharmaceutical or purpose-built units, the data-logger or thermometer is recommended to be placed in a central location, however, other placements may be suitable because these units maintain more consistent temperatures throughout the unit.</p>
	
	<p>The data logger or thermometer probes must not be:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Suspended from wire shelves in the unit</li>
		<li>Suspended by tape attached to the inside ceiling of the unit</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Providers enrolled in the TVFC Program are required to have in each refrigerator and/or freezer that stores TVFC vaccine, a calibrated data logger or thermometer accompanied with a valid and up-to-date certificate issued either by an International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) laboratory or, if not ILAC accredited, the certificate must contain measurement results and a statement indicating that it meets International Organization for Standardization/International Electronic Commission (ISO/IEC) 17025 standards.  A valid certificate of calibration matching the serial number of the data logger or thermometer in use is to be posted on the refrigerator and/or freezer.</p>
	
	<p>The certificate is valid for two years from the date of calibration or the date of expiration, whichever occurs first.  A continuous-read temperature-recording device does not replace the requirement for a certified data logger or thermometer.</p>
	
	<p>All certificates must contain:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Model number</li>
		<li>Serial number</li>
		<li>Date of calibration</li>
		<li>Measurement results that indicates the unit passed the test and the documented uncertainty is within suitable limits (recommended uncertainty is &#177;1&#176;F [&#177;0.5&#176;C])</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>All TVFC providers must have at least one backup data logger or thermometer with a valid and current certificate of calibration readily available to ensure that temperature assessment and recordings can be performed twice a day.  Backup thermometers must be readily available in case a thermometer in use is no longer working appropriately or calibration testing of the current equipment is required.</p>
	
	<p>The CDC recommends that the backup data logger or thermometer be stored outside of the storage unit until needed to avoid vaccine space issues and differing temperature readings leading to potential confusion.</p>
	
	<p>The backup data logger or thermometer should have a different calibration retesting date.  If both thermometers have the same calibration date, they will need to be sent out for recalibration at the same time.  By having different calibration dates there will always be one thermometer available for use.</p>
	
	<p>Refrigerators and freezers that are manufactured with built-in temperature monitoring capabilities are required to be accompanied by a certificate of calibration for the thermometer, and the thermostat must be capable of being adjusted by the TVFC provider as needed to maintain proper temperature.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, TVFC providers are required have a room thermometer to record the room temperature when a temperature excursion occurs in a vaccine storage unit.  This is important for making vaccine viability determinations, if necessary.</p>
	
	<p>The figure below, presents an example of a valid certificate of calibration.</p>

	<h2>Vaccine Storage Requirements</h2>
	
	<p>Some vaccines are sensitive to light and their efficacy could be compromised if exposed to the light.  All TVFC providers must safeguard the following vaccines from light: MMR, MMRV, HPV, MCV4, Hib vaccines, Rotavirus, and Varicella.</p>
	
	<p>All vaccines, with the exception of Varicella, MMR and MMRV, are to be stored in the refrigerator and must never be frozen.  Varicella, MMR and MMRV must be stored in the freezer in a continuously frozen state &#60;5&#176;F (-15&#176;C).</p>
	
	<p>All vaccines must be stored in the central area of the refrigerator and/or freezer shelves, not in the vegetable bins, meat drawers, in the door, or on the floor.  Storing vaccines in the central body of the refrigerator and/or freezer helps maintain proper temperatures for the vaccines.</p>
	
	<p>Vaccines must be stored and/or stacked to allow cold air to circulate freely.</p>
	
	<p>All TVFC vaccines must be stored separately from privately purchased vaccines and must be labeled accordingly.</p>
	
	<p>All TVFC providers also enrolled in the ASN Program must separate TVFC provided pediatric doses from ASN supplied adult doses.  All TVFC providers must identify sufficient alternate space to store vaccines and maintain the cold chain during any period when the refrigerator/freezer is out of service.</p>
	
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Protective-Equipment">
	<a class="bookmark" title="protective-equipment" name="protective-equipment"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Protective Equipment</h2>
	
	<p>The power supply for vaccine storage units must be protected by following the information below:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Plug unit directly into a wall outlet, do NOT use multi-outlet power strips</li>
		<li>Do NOT use outlets with built in circuit switchers</li>
		<li>Do NOT use power outlets that can be activated by a wall switch</li>
		<li>Plug only one unit into an outlet</li>
		<li>Plug guards are required to be used on all refrigerators and freezers that store TVFC vaccines.  Plug guards are effective tools in preventing the accidental unplugging of equipment</li>
		<li>Plug guards are supplied by the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) and quality assurance contractors</li>
		<li>A "Do Not Unplug" sign is required to be posted on or near all outlets of refrigerators and freezers used for storing vaccine</li>
		<li>A "Do Not Disconnect" sign must be posted by each circuit breaker</li>
	</ul>
	
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Personnel">
	<a class="bookmark" title="personnel" name="personnel"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Personnel</h2>
	
	<p>Vaccine viability depends on the knowledge and habits of the clinic staff.  All staff who handle TVFC vaccine must be trained on proper storage, handling, and administration of vaccine.  The facility is required to designate a primary and at least one back-up TVFC vaccine coordinator to ensure that the TVFC vaccines are handled and stored properly.  Both TVFC vaccine coordinators are required to complete the mandatory <a title="CDC You Call the Shots" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html">CDC You Call the Shots</a> training modules annually and provide the Certificates of Completion to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) during the re-enrollment period.</p>
	<p>All staff who handle TVFC vaccine must be aware of and familiar with the written procedures for emergency situations to assure continued viability of the vaccines.</p>
	<p>New employees must be adequately trained regarding the proper storage and handling of vaccines prior to administering the TVFC vaccines.  Replacement Primary or Secondary Vaccine Coordinators must complete the mandatory <a title="CDC You Call the Shots" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/youcalltheshots.html">CDC You Call the Shots</a> training modules and provide the Certificates of Completion to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).</p>
	<p>The TVFC Program has developed the Texas Vaccine Education Online (VEO) modules to provide short online training courses on topics related to vaccines.  After enrolling online, individuals may log in and take any course free of charge.  Additional information and a course listing are available at <a title="www.vaccineeducationonline.org" href="http://www.vaccineeducationonline.org/">www.vaccineeducationonline.org</a>.</p>

	<hr/>
	<h2>Mass Vaccination Clinic Requirements</h2>
	
	To ensure vaccine storage and handling for mass vaccination clinics is managed properly, the following storage and handling practices are required:
	
	<ul>
		<li>All TVFC vaccine must be ordered and shipped directly to a location within the ordering provider’s DSHS HSR.</li>
		<li>Vaccine received in one DSHS HSR must be administered within that same DSHS HSR.</li>
		<li>The vaccine must be transported, not shipped, to local schools or other community sites where the mass vaccination clinics will be held.</li>
		<li>Only amounts of vaccines that are appropriate, based on TVFC need, should be transported to each scheduled clinic.</li>
		<li>Record of the Vaccine being transported should be tracked in order to maintain accountability for monthly reporting in EVI.  This includes:
			<ul>
				<li>Vaccine type(s)</li>
				<li>Quantity of each type</li>
				<li>NDC numbers</li>
				<li>Lot numbers</li>
				<li>Expiration dates</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Vaccine must be transported to and from the scheduled mass vaccination clinic at appropriate temperatures and must be monitored by a continuous monitoring and recording device with a digital display and probe in buffered material.  Temperatures during transport must be documented.</li>
		<li><a title="TVFC Publications Page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx">Temperature form EC-105</a> may be used to document hourly temperatures</li>
		<li>Upon arrival at the mass vaccination clinic site, the TVFC mass vaccination provider must ensure that the vaccine is stored to maintain the appropriate temperature throughout the clinic day.</li>
		<li>Since the vaccine is at a temporary location, temperature data must be reviewed and documented every hour during the day of the clinic using a continuous monitoring and recording device with a digital display and probe in buffered material.</li>
		<li>After each clinic day, the TVFC mass vaccination provider must perform a physical count of the remaining vaccine and assess data temperatures prior to placing vaccine back into storage units to prevent inadvertent administration of vaccine that may have been compromised.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Vaccines exposed to temperature excursions must be segregated in a Vaccine Quarantine Bag and labeled "Do Not Use" until further information can be gathered from the manufacturer(s) and the TVFC Program on the viability of the vaccine.  The vaccine should be kept at appropriate temperatures until the viability determination is made.</p>
	
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Storage-Handling-Plan">
	<a class="bookmark" title="storage-handling-plan" name="storage-handling-plan"></a>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Routine and Emergency Storage and Handling Plan</h2>
	
	<p>All TVFC providers must have plans for routine and emergency vaccine management.  The TVFC Program provides templates for the CDC <a title="Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (E11-14497)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (E11-14497)</a> and the <a title="Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (E11-11190)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (E11-11190)</a>.  A TVFC provider is not required to use these templates, but they are valuable tools available to providers should they need assistance in developing and emergency plan.  If the templates are not used, the TVFC provider must develop routine and emergency vaccine management plans that include all of the information on the templates provided by the TVFC Program.</p>
	<p>The CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit and the Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan Checklist must be reviewed and updated annually.  They must include the signature, name, and title of the preparer as well as the date the documents were reviewed.</p>
	<p>The following items must be addressed in the Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Identify a responsible person and a responsible back up person to carry out the contingency plan.  Be sure to include contact information such as home, office, and cell phone numbers for both persons.  Contact information must be updated annually and when changes occur.</li>
		<li>Identify an alternative location to take the TVFC vaccine for storage.  A location with a power generator or other alternate source of power such as a hospital, pharmacy, or grocery store is preferable.  Ideally, this facility must be located within a reasonable distance from the TVFC provider’s clinic, and can maintain the cold chain during any period when the TVFC provider’s refrigerator or freezer is out of service.</li>
		<li>Adequate supplies in amounts sufficient for packing and transporting the entire TVFC vaccine inventory needs to be available in case of an emergency.</li>
		<li>Be sure to contact the emergency storage location for their approval before including them as part of the plan and list their contact person(s) and phone number(s) on the plan.  A back-up location must be considered in case the primary alternative location is unavailable or unable to store the vaccine inventory for any reason.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>All TVFC providers will be asked to provide a copy of their CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit and Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan Checklist at TVFC Compliance Site Visits.  The documents must be posted on or near the refrigerator or freezer containing the TVFC vaccine.  The TVFC provider must ensure all employees involved with vaccine management are aware of this plan.</p>

	<h2>Vaccine Protection in the Event of an Emergency</h2>
	
	<p>As noted above, every facility maintaining an inventory of state-provided vaccine is required to develop and display an <a title="Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (E11-11190)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling PlanChecklist (E11-11190)</a> and in the event of emergencies that could result in the loss of vaccine.  Once completed, this template can serve as the required Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan.</p>
	<p>All TVFC providers must review and update this plan annually or more frequently if there are any changes to the plan or changes in staff responsible for vaccine management, storage, and handling.  The most current <a title="Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (E11-11190)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan (E11-11190)</a> will be reviewed during <a title="TVFC Compliance Site Visits" href="/immunize/tvfc/site-visits.aspx">TVFC compliance site visits</a> and any unannounced storage and handling visits.</p>
	<p>In the event of an emergency, a TVFC provider must contact their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) immediately to inform them of the situation.</p>
	<p>The TVFC provider will need to be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The temperature of the vaccine</li>
		<li>The amount of vaccine</li>
		<li>Expiration dates of the vaccine</li>
		<li>How long the vaccine was exposed to inappropriate temperatures</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The TVFC provider will need to specify the following steps when transporting vaccine to the alternate location:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Note the time of the emergency situation/power outage</li>
		<li>Note the temperature of the refrigerator and freezer before removing any vaccine for transportation</li>
		<li>Indicate which containers are being used and how the refrigerated vaccine will be packed for transportation (i.e., conditioned water bottles separated from the vaccine by layered packing materials to prevent freezing and damage)</li>
		<li>If frozen vaccine is being transported, indicate whether a portable freezer or cooler will be used and what packing materials will be used, if applicable</li>
		<li>Take inventory of the vaccine as it is moved into the transport container, being careful to indicate the number of doses of each vaccine and the expiration dates.  Use the Vaccine Transfer Authorization Form</li>
		<li>Ensure that the Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan Checklist is available for documenting this process</li>

	<hr/>
	<h2>Cold Chain Management and Vaccine Transport</h2>
	
	<p>The TVFC Program requires vaccines to be stored properly from the time they are manufactured until the time they are administered.  The system used to maintain and distribute vaccines in optimal condition is called the cold chain.</p>
	<p>All TVFC providers must identify sufficient alternative space to store TVFC vaccines and maintain the cold chain during any period when the refrigerator or freezer is out of service.  Adequate supplies for packing and transporting the entire TVFC provider’s vaccine supply/inventory needs to be available in case of an emergency.</p>
	<p>Avoid prolonged temperature extremes inside vehicles, by using transport containers containing the vaccines and taking the quickest route possible.  Do not leave vaccines unattended in vehicles.  Do not place vaccines in the trunk of a vehicle.</p>
	<p>Pack refrigerated vaccines first.  If followed, the directions below will help maintain the cold chain for up to eight hours during transport of refrigerated and frozen vaccines.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>Refrigerated Vaccine Transport</h3>
	
	<br/>
	<h4>Assemble Packing Supplies</h4>
	<p>CDC recommends transport with a portable refrigerator unit.  If this type of unit is not available, a hard-sided insulated cooler with at least 2-inch walls, Styrofoam vaccine shipping containers, or other qualified container may be used if it can maintain the recommended temperature range (between 36&#176;F and 46&#176;F [(2&#176;C and 8&#176;C]).  Label the container with facility name and "<em>Fragile Vaccines – Do Not Freeze</em>" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Hard-sided coolers, Styrofoam vaccine shipping container, or other qualified container are required:
			<ul>
				<li>Coolers should be large enough to hold the TVFC provider’s locations typical supply of refrigerated vaccines</li>
				<li>Original shipping boxes from the manufacturer can be used, if available</li>
				<li>Do NOT use soft-sided collapsible coolers</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Conditioned frozen water bottles are required:
			<ul>
				<li>Use 16.9 oz. bottles for medium/large coolers or 8 oz. bottles for small coolers</li>
				<li>DO NOT reuse coolant packs from original vaccine shipping containers, they may freeze vaccine instead</li>
				<li>Freeze water bottles, but before use, condition the frozen water bottles.  This is done by placing them in a sink filled with several inches of cool or lukewarm water until there is a layer of water forming near the surface of the bottle.  The bottle is properly conditioned when the ice block spins freely within the bottle when rotated.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Insulating material – Two of each layer is needed:
			<ul>
				<li>Insulating cushioning material – Bubble wrap, packing foam, or Styrofoam for a layer, at least 1-inch thick, above and below the vaccines.  Make sure it covers the cardboard completely</li>
				<li>Do NOT use packing peanuts or other lose material that may shift during transport and</li>
				<li>Corrugated cardboard – Two pieces cut to fit the internal dimensions of the cooler(s) and placed between the insulating cushioning material and the conditioned water bottles.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Temperature monitoring device – A digital data logger or thermometer with a buffered probe should be used:
			<ul>
				<li>The probe is buffered by pre-chilling it in the refrigerator for at least five hours prior to transport</li>
				<li>Data logger or thermometer must have current and valid certificate of calibration testing</li>
				<li>Data logger or thermometer must be accurate within + or -1&#176;F (+ or -0.5&#176;C) and</li>
				<li>The temperature monitoring device currently stored in the refrigerator can be used for transport, as long as there is a device in place to measure the temperature for remaining vaccines.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br/>
	<h4>Packing for Transport</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Line the bottom of the cooler with a single layer of conditioned water bottles</li>
		<li>Place a sheet of corrugated cardboard over the water bottles</li>
		<li>Place an inch of insulating material (bubble-wrap, packing foam, or Styrofoam) over the cardboard</li>
		<li>Stack boxes of vaccines and diluents on top of insulating material</li>
		<li>When cooler is halfway full, place the buffered temperature probe in the center of the vaccines, but keep the display out of the cooler</li>
		<li>Add the remaining vaccine and diluents</li>
		<li>Cover vaccines with another layer of insulating material</li>
		<li>Add the second layer of corrugated cardboard and</li>
		<li>Fill the remaining space in the cooler with conditioned water bottles.
			<ul>
				<li>Recording Temperature during Transport</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Close the lid of the cooler securely and attach the digital data logger or thermometer display and a temperature log to the top of the lid</li>
		<li>Use the Temperature Recording Form to record the time, as well as the temperature inside of the storage unit at the time the vaccines are removed</li>
		<li>Record the temperature of the transport container on the Temperature Recording Form.  If vaccines are kept in a transport container for longer than an hour, record the temperatures hourly</li>
		<li>As soon as the destination site is reached, check and record the vaccine temperature</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If the vaccine is:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Between 36&#176;F and 46&#176;F (2&#176;C and 8&#176;C), place it in the refrigerator</li>
		<li>Below 36&#176;F or above 46&#176;F (2&#176;C and 8&#176;C), place the vaccine in a quarantine bag, place it in the refrigerator and immediately contact the vaccine manufacturer to determine viability</li>
		<li>Contact the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) immediately with the manufacturer’s viability determination</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>Note: </strong>Always keep vaccine properly stored until otherwise instructed by the vaccine manufacturer or the TVFC Program.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>Frozen Vaccine Transport in an Emergency Situation</h3>
	<p>Varicella vaccines are fragile!  The CDC and the vaccine manufacturer do not recommend transporting Varicella.  If these vaccines need to be relocated in an emergency situation, the following steps must be taken.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h4>Assemble Packing Supplies</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Portable Freezer</strong> – The CDC recommends transport with a portable freezer unit that maintains the temperature between -58&#176;F and +5&#176;F (-50&#176;C and -15&#176;C).  Portable freezers may be available for rent in some places.  Label the portable freezer with the facility name and "Fragile Vaccines – Keep Frozen" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit.</li>
		<li><strong>Thermometer</strong> – Use a certified and calibrated thermometer or digital data logger with a current and valid certificate of calibration testing.  Prepare the thermometer or data logger by placing it in a freezer unit at least two hours before packing the vaccine.</li>
		<li><strong>Cooler</strong> (if portable freezer is unavailable) – If a portable freezer is unavailable, a hard-sided insulated cooler with at least 2-inch walls, Styrofoam vaccine shipping container, or other qualified container may be used if temperatures between -58&#176;F and +5&#176;F (-50&#176;C and -15&#176;C) can be maintained.  Label the container with the facility name and "Fragile Vaccines – Keep Frozen" and the date and time the vaccine was removed from the permanent storage unit.</li>
		<li><strong>Frozen water bottles</strong> (if portable freezer is unavailable) – Water bottles must be frozen.</li>
		<li><strong>Dry ice is not allowed</strong> to be used for transporting vaccines, even for temporary storage or emergency transport.  Dry ice may subject vaccine to temperatures colder than -58&#176;F  (-50&#176;C).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><strong>If a portable freezer is not available</strong> and a cooler must be used, follow the packing instructions for transporting refrigerated vaccine, and in addition:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure that the water bottles used in the cooler are frozen</li>
		<li>Place a calibrated data logger or thermometer in the container used for transport as close as possible to the vaccine</li>
		<li>Use a Temperature Recording Form to record the time, as well as the temperature inside of the storage unit at the time the vaccines are removed.  Also record the temperature of the transport container on the Temperature Recording Form</li>
		<li>Continually monitor the vaccine temperature</li>
		<li>Immediately upon arrival at the destination, place vaccines in a freezer at a temperature range between -58&#176;F and +5&#176;F (-50&#176;C and -15&#176;C).  Any stand-alone freezer that maintains these temperatures is acceptable.</li>
		<li>Document the time the vaccine was removed from the transport container and placed in the alternate storage unit.  Also document the temperature of the vaccine when it was removed from the transport container and placed in the alternate storage unit</li>
		<li>Immediately contact the manufacturer, or Immunization Unit Nurse Consultant for viability data and guidance any time frozen vaccine has been exposed to a temperature above +5&#176;F (-15&#176;C).  Do not discard the vaccine without contacting the manufacturer</li>
		<li>Viability determination will be made on a case by case basis.  Contact the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) with the viability determination from the manufacturer.</li>
	</ul>

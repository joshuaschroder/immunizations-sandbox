<h2>Compliance Site Visits</h2>

<p>Providers at DSHS Health Service Regional (HSRs) clinics and Local Health Departments (LHDs) participating in the TVFC Program will receive a scheduled Compliance Site Visit from a DSHS HSR reviewer annually.  The DSHS HSRs are responsible for conducting annual Compliance Visits at all DSHS HSR field offices and LHDs.  By signing the VFC Program Provider Agreement, the signing physician agrees to allow a DSHS or DSHS-contracted entity to conduct a Compliance Site Visit.</p>

<p>Providers at private facilities can expect to receive a Compliance Site Visit at least once every other year by TMF Health Quality Institute (TMF), a DSHS quality assurance (QA) contractor.  By signing the VFC Program Provider Agreement, the signing physician agrees to allow TMF to conduct a Compliance Site Visit.</p>

<p>Provider Compliance Site Visits are data driven, not date driven, to ensure that providers with the most needs are seen first.  The purpose of the visit is to assess, support, and educate the clinic regarding TVFC policies and procedures.  If areas of need are identified, the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) will provide a follow-up call or visit to assist the clinic with any changes or questions.</p>

<p>Providers will be contacted prior to the scheduled Compliance Site Visit and will receive a confirmation letter, email, or fax with the date, time, materials needed, and summary of the site visit process.</p>

<p>During a Compliance Site Visit, the reviewer will need access to the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A space to work</li>
	<li>A power source (Internet connectivity is recommended)</li>
	<li>Access to patient records</li>
	<li>Current and past temperature logs or data for the last three months, or longer if issues are found</li>
	<li>Current and past Vaccine Borrowing Forms</li>
	<li>The circuit breaker, if applicable</li>
	<li>Admitting and billing personnel to clarify eligibility screening and billing processes and</li>
	<li>All vaccine storage units where TVFC vaccine is stored</li>
</ul>

<p>The Compliance Site Visit is split into two types to ensure that each site is being evaluated based on the number and ages of eligible patients served.  These types are described below.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="A-visit" name="A-visit"></a>
<br/>
<h3>"A" site (VFC Compliance Visit &amp; AFIX Visit)</h3>
<p>The "A" visit is the VFC Questionnaire and an AFIX visit utilizing the Comprehensive Clinical Assessment Software Application (CoCASA).  The focus of "A" visits is for childhood assessment and review of 10-50 records on children 24-35 months of age.  The reviewers pull qualifying records randomly (up to 50 records).</p>
<p>An "Adolescent" Site visit is performed if there are not enough charts for children in the 24-35 months' age group to perform an 
"A" site visit.  The adolescent site visit is conducted with a minimum of 20 records (50 preferred) of adolescents in the age group of 13-18 years.  The reviewer randomly selects records from the provider's charts.</p>


<a class="bookmark" title="B-visit" name="B-visit"></a>
<br/>
<h3>"B" site (VFC Compliance Visit only)</h3>
<p>The “B” visit consists only of the VFC Compliance Visit, if there are less than 10 records in the age group of 24-35 months and less than 20 records in the age group of 13-18 years.  The reviewer randomly selects records from the provider’s charts.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="C-visit" name="C-visit"></a>
<br/>
<h3>"C" site (AFIX Follow-up Visit only)</h3>
<p>The “C” visits consists only of the AFIX follow-up Visit.</p>

<a class="bookmark" title="follow-up" name="follow-up"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Follow-Up Activities</h3>
<p>Upon completion of the Compliance Site Visit, the reviewer will discuss the outcomes of the visit with the provider’s TVFC Vaccine Coordinator.  The discussion will include a review of the site visit findings and a formal follow-up plan with a timeline that addresses any issues of non-compliance or opportunities for improvement.  The provider’s TVFC Vaccine Coordinator must sign the Acknowledgement of Receipt following the visit.  The Acknowledgement of Receipt is the document that attests to the fact that a Compliance Site Visit was completed, the provider received the results of the visit, and that both the reviewer and the provider’s TVFC Vaccine </p>

<p>Coordinator understand any non-compliance issues identified and the actions necessary to address them.</p>

<p>The responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) will conduct any required follow-up activities.  The purpose of follow-up activities is to ensure that areas for improvement identified by the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) or TMF QA contractor are understood at the clinic and corrective actions have been identified and implemented.</p>

<p>Follow-up activities are conducted as necessary to correct the problems and are dependent upon the severity of the non-compliance issues and the follow-up action plan.  Follow up activities can include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Visiting the clinic to observe corrective actions</li>
	<li>Calling the TVFC Vaccine Coordinator at the clinic</li>
	<li>Sending a letter to address the deficient items identified during the site visit</li>
	<li>Determining the provider’s compliance with the corrective action plans, if applicable</li>
</ul>

<p>The responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) works with providers on non-compliance issues by providing education and guidance regarding corrective actions, including monitoring, if implemented.</p>

<p>If a provider exhibits habitual non-compliance and does not follow corrective actions in response to education, the provider may be put on probation and their vaccine orders may be withheld.  If non-compliance continues the provider may be suspended or terminated from the TVFC Program.</p>


<a class="bookmark" title="EMR" name="EMR"></a>
<br/>
<h3>Electronic Medical Records (EMR)</h3>
<p>Providers with Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have the following immunization record review options, one of which must be available at the time of the visit:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A dedicated staff member who can log-in to the EMR and sit with the field reviewer throughout the record review process to pull up EMR immunization and eligibility records, or</li>
	<li>Print outs from the EMR of the immunization records and documentation of the child’s eligibility.  The immunization records need to include all immunization history including records from other providers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not acceptable to have a staff member log-in and then turn the EMR screens over to the reviewer; the staff person is required to be present.  The TVFC Program or the TMF QA contractor will not pay for, or reimburse providers for the copies, when the provider chooses to print out immunization records from their EMR system.</p>

<h2>Unannounced Storage and Handling Visit</h2>
<p>Unannounced storage and handling visits may be conducted to serve as “spot checks” for proper vaccine storage and handling.  Unannounced visits focus on vaccine storage and handling.  The DSHS HSRs and LHDs prioritize both public and private sites for unannounced visits based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Loss of publicly purchased vaccine</li>
	<li>Storing vaccines incorrectly</li>
	<li>Improper documentation of temperature logs</li>
	<li>Vaccine orders not consistent with provider profile data</li>
	<li>Newly enrolled provider</li>
	<li>Determination of the provider’s compliance with the corrective action plans</li>
</ul>

<p>Vaccine storage and handling issues are identified and addressed immediately during unannounced visits.  The provider is expected to make onsite corrections to safeguard the vaccine.</p>

<h2>Annual TVFC Provider Feedback Survey</h2>
<p>In addition, the TVFC Program will conduct an annual TVFC Provider Feedback Survey to help identify areas of the TVFC Program that are working well and those that need some additional assistance.  The survey will be electronically sent to all providers and the final results will be collected and submitted to program staff for review.  Questions in the survey will address provider satisfaction with the current vaccine ordering and shipping practices, TVFC policies and procedures, reporting requirements, customer service provided by TVFC state, regional, and local staff as well as the communications methods of the TVFC Program.  The survey will also ask TVFC providers about their use of the Texas Immunization Information System (IIS), ImmTrac as part of their daily practice.</p>

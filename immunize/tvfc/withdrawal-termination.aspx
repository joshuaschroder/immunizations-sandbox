<h2>Provider Withdrawal from TVFC</h2>

<p>Any TVFC provider wanting to withdraw from the TVFC Program must contact their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) to arrange for vaccine pick-up and assistance with final paperwork. Prior to withdrawal, the provider must complete a <a title="Provider Withdrawal Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">Provider Withdrawal Form</a> and submit the form to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Provider Probation and Suspension from TVFC</h2>

<p>A TVFC provider may be put on probation and temporarily lose their ordering privileges and administrative privileges may be suspended for a period of 180 days or longer.  This is dependent upon the severity of the non-compliance issues and/or failure to complete the TVFC required corrective action plans set in place to correct failures in vaccine management, non-compliance issues, including, but not limited to, failure to complete <a title="TVFC provider re-enrollment" href="/immunize/tvfc/provider-eligibility.aspx#re-enrollment">re-enrollment</a> timely, failures in vaccine management, <a title="proper storage and handling practices" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx">proper storage and handling practices</a>, and <a title="monthly reporting requirements" href="/immunize/tvfc/reporting-requirements.aspx">monthly reporting requirements</a>.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Provider Termination from TVFC</h2>

<p>A TVFC provider may be dis-enrolled for continued non-compliance with TVFC requirements, failure to complete the re-enrollment process, or failure to complete the TVFC required corrective actions associated with non-compliance.</p>

<p>Providers may be terminated for non-compliance with TVFC requirements and/or fraud and abuse. Information regarding fraud and abuse in the TVFC Program may be found on the <a title="fraud and abuse page" href="/immunize/tvfc/fraud-abuse.aspx">fraud and abuse page</a>. </p>

<p>All TVFC providers are notified of their termination from the program via a signed letter from the Immunization Unit Director.  Terminated TVFC providers are removed from the TVFC Program for a period of one year before the provider may be considered for re-enrollment.  An orientation about the TVFC Program guidelines, on-site education, and a focused site review assessment to confirm that the problems have been resolved are required prior to re-enrollment in the TVFC Program.</p>

<p>The provider must have a current, valid medical / nursing / pharmacy license in order to administer vaccine in the state of Texas.  In addition, the TVFC Program checks the <a title="OIG List of Excluded Individuals or Entities" href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/">OIG List of Excluded Individuals or Entities</a> for federally-funded healthcare programs to ensure that a pending provider is eligible to participate in the TVFC Program.  The provider must also meet and perform all <a title="enrollment processes" href="/immunize/tvfc/provider-eligibility.aspx">enrollment processes</a> including demonstrating that they have the proper <a title="vaccine storage and handling procedures" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx">vaccine storage and handling procedures</a> in place prior to receiving vaccines.</p>

<p>In addition, TVFC providers terminated for instances of fraud and abuse may be considered for re-enrollment after one year only if the provider is actively enrolled in Medicaid at that time and has been removed from the OIGâ€™s LEIE.</p>

<p>The Vaccine Management Group (VMG) Manager and Vaccine Operations Group (VOG) Manager, in consultation with the Immunization Unit Director, have the authority to determine whether or not a provider is eligible to re-enroll in the TVFC Program.</p>

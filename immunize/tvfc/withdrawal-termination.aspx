<h2>Provider Withdrawal from TVFC</h2>
<p>Providers wanting to withdraw from the TVFC Program must <a title="contact the TVFC program" href="/immunize/tvfc/contact.aspx">contact</a> the responsible entity (DSHS health service region or local health department) to arrange for vaccine pick-up and assistance with final paperwork. Prior to withdrawal, the provider must complete a <a title="Provider Withdrawal Form" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#provider-enrollment">Provider Withdrawal Form</a> and submit the form to the DSHS health service region or local health department.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Provider Termination from TVFC</h2>
<p>Providers may be terminated for non-compliance with TVFC requirements and/or fraud and abuse. Information regarding fraud and abuse in the TVFC Program may be found in <a title="Chapter 6 of the TVFC Manual -- Fraud and Abuse" href="/immunize/tvfc/fraud-abuse.aspx">Chapter 6 of the TVFC Manual -- Fraud and Abuse</a>. </p>
<p>Providers who have been terminated from the TVFC Program must wait one year before being allowed to re-enroll. An orientation of the TVFC guidelines, on-site education and a focused site review assessment to confirm that the problems have been resolved will occur prior to their re-enrollment into the program. </p>
<p>The provider must have a current and valid license to administer vaccine in the state of Texas. In addition, the TVFC Program checks the <a title="OIG List of Excluded Individuals or Entities" href="http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/">OIG List of Excluded Individuals or Entities</a> for federally-funded healthcare programs to ensure that a pending provider is eligible to participate in the TVFC Program. TVFC requires the provider to meet and perform all <a title="enrollment processes" href="/immunize/tvfc/provider-eligibility.aspx">enrollment processes</a>, including demonstrating that they have the proper <a title="vaccine storage and procedures" href="/immunize/tvfc/vaccine-storage-handling.aspx">vaccine storage and procedures</a> in place prior to receiving vaccines.</p>

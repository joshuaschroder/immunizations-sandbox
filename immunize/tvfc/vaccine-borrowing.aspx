<p>Vaccine Borrowing -- Using publicly purchased vaccine to vaccinate non-TVFC eligible patients.</p>
<p>TVFC providers are expected to maintain adequate inventory of vaccine for both their TVFC eligible and privately insured clients. Vaccines supplied by the TVFC Program cannot be provided to a non-TVFC eligible client. Administering TVFC vaccines to a non-TVFC eligible patient is considered fraud. Providers must not use TVFC vaccines as a replacement system for filling the vaccine needs of a non-TVFC privately insured client. </p>
<p>If a TVFC dose(s) is accidently administered to a non-TVFC eligible client, the provider must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Complete a TVFC <a title="Vaccine Borrowing Form (EF11-14171)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">Vaccine Borrowing Form (EF11-14171)</a>. Each vaccine that was administered to a non-TVFC eligible client must be listed on a separate row on the form.</li>
	<li>Replace the vaccine immediately and account for the replacement in the Electronic Vaccine Inventory (EVI) system.</li>
	<li>Fax a copy of the Vaccine Borrowing Form to the appropriate DSHS health service region within 24 hours. Providers must follow HIPAA guidelines when faxing this form to the DSHS health service region.</li>
	<li>The Vaccine Borrowing Form must be kept as part of the TVFC Program records for a minimum five years and be made easily available.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adequate vaccine supply must be maintained in accordance with the clinic's patient population (TVFC eligible and private patients). TVFC vaccine and private vaccine must be kept separate and clearly labeled as such. Providers must track vaccine usage and account for all doses of TVFC supplied vaccine.</p>

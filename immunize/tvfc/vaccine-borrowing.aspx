<p>Vaccine Borrowing is the utilization of TVFC vaccines as a replacement system for filling the vaccine needs of non-TVFC patients.</p>

<p>The CDC requires that state immunization programs enhance oversight of all vaccine borrowing within VFC provider sites.  As such, the TVFC Program is enforcing its policy of not allowing vaccine borrowing between TVFC and non-TVFC patients.</p>

<p>All TVFC providers are expected to maintain an adequate inventory of vaccine for both their TVFC-eligible and privately insured patients.  Vaccines supplied by the TVFC Program cannot be provided to a non-TVFC-eligible patient.  Undocumented borrowing and administering of TVFC vaccines to a non-TVFC patient is considered fraud.  All TVFC providers must not use TVFC vaccines as a replacement system for filling the vaccine needs of a non-TVFC privately insured patient.</p>

<p>If a TVFC dose(s) is accidently administered to a non-TVFC-eligible client, the TVFC provider must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete the <a title="TVFC Vaccine Borrowing Form (EF11-14171)" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">TVFC Vaccine Borrowing Form (EF11-14171)</a>.  Each vaccine that was administered to a non-TVFC-eligible client must be listed on a separate row on the form.</li>
<li>Replace the vaccine immediately and account for the replacement in EVI</li>
<li>Fax a copy of the TVFC Vaccine Borrowing Form to their responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD) within 24 hours.  Adherence to HIPAA guidelines is mandatory when faxing this form to the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD).</li>
</ul>

<p>The TVFC Vaccine Borrowing Form must be kept as part of the TVFC Program records for a minimum of five years and be made easily available.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the TVFC provider to ensure that all staff members are familiar with TVFC Program requirements.  Adequate vaccine supply must be maintained in accordance with the clinicâ€™s patient population (TVFC and private patients).  The TVFC vaccine and private vaccine must be kept separately and clearly labeled as such.  All TVFC providers must track vaccine usage and account for all doses of TVFC vaccine.</p>

<p>Continued non-compliance with TVFC policies and procedures may be considered fraud and abuse.  The TVFC provider may be referred to CMS Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office.</p>

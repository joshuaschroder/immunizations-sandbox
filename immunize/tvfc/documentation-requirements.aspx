	<h2>Vaccine Record Keeping Requirements</h2>
	
	<p>The 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury and Compensation Act requires providers nationwide to record specific information in the medical record each time a vaccine is administered. The following information is required:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Name of vaccine administered</li>
		<li>Date vaccine was administered (month, day, year)</li>
		<li>Date vaccine information statement (VIS) was given</li>
		<li>Publication date on VIS</li>
		<li>Name of vaccine manufacturer</li>
		<li>Vaccine lot number</li>
		<li>Name and title of the healthcare provider administering the vaccine</li>
		<li>Address of the clinic where the vaccine was administered</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Immunization cards for providers (C-100) and clients (C-102 and C-104) can be ordered free of charge from the DSHS Immunizations Unit (See <a title="Ordering Forms and Literature" href="/immunize/tvfc/ordering-literature.aspx">Ordering Forms and Literature</a>). These cards are designed to capture all information required when vaccines are administered.</p>
	
	<p>The TVFC Program suggests the following recommendations regarding record keeping:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Designate an immunization nurse to answer immunization questions for staff and parents</li>
		<li>File patient records, keeping the immunization record (C-100) and TVFC Patient Eligibility forms together</li>
		<li>Place immunization records at the front of each patient’s chart and make immunizations a priority</li>
		<li>Encourage parents to bring their children’s immunization records (C-102) with them to facilitate complete documentation in the child’s record of previous immunization history</li>
		<li>If a child presents with no immunization record, obtain the history through the Texas Immunization Registry (ImmTrac), or call previous providers to obtain the history</li>
		<li>Empower all staff to become "Ommunization Advocate" and have them assess each child’s immunization status at every encounter</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Give a personal immunization record to each vaccine recipient showing the date (month, day, and year) of when each vaccine was administered</p>
	<p>Copies of the immunization records must be maintained for five years and made available on request by the TVFC Program, the responsible entity (DSHS HSR or LHD), or DSHS quality assurance contractor.</p>

	<h2>ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry</h2>
	
	<p>The TVFC Program recommends the use of <a title="ImmTrac, the Texas Immunization Registry" href="http://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/immtrac/">ImmTrac</a> to maintain patient records.  ImmTrac is operated by the DSHS Immunization Unit and can safely store immunization records in one electronic system.  Before providers can submit the immunization information to the registry, they will need to enroll in ImmTrac.  If ImmTrac is utilized, Texas Law requires medical providers to report all immunizations administered to children 17 years of age and younger to ImmTrac within 30 days of administering the vaccine.</p>
	
	<p>Both adults and children can register with ImmTrac, which can store their immunization information for a lifetime.  Individuals who have turned 18 years old and were already in ImmTrac as minors, must sign an adult consent form by their 26th birthday to keep their immunization information in ImmTrac.</p>
	
	<p>For information about ImmTrac or to register to be an ImmTrac user, please call the ImmTrac Customer Support Line at (800) 348-9158 or visit the <a title="ImmTrac website" href="http://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/immtrac/">ImmTrac website</a>.</p>

	<h2>Decision to Not Vaccinate</h2>
	
	<p>Maintaining public confidence in immunizations is critical for preventing a decline in vaccination rates that can result in disease outbreaks.  While the majority of parents believe in the benefits of immunizations and have their children vaccinated, some have concerns about the safety of vaccines.  The concerns about vaccine safety are preventing some parents from having their children immunized.  Overcoming barriers requires both knowledge and interpersonal skills on the part of the provider.  Immunization providers should have an understanding of vaccines, up-to-date recommendations, and reliable resources to direct parents and patients to in order to find accurate information.  Also, the providers will need to have the skills necessary to deal with fears and misconceptions about vaccines, and the ability to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for patients.</p>
	
	<p>When a parent or patient initiates the discussion regarding a vaccine concern, the provider should discuss the specific concern, and provide factual information.  The VIS provides an outline for discussing vaccine benefits and risks.  Providers can reinforce key points regarding each vaccine, including safety, and emphasize risks encountered by unimmunized children. Parents should be informed about state laws pertaining to <a title="school or child care entry" href="/immunize/school/school-requirements.aspx">school or child care entry</a>, which might require unimmunized children to stay home from school during outbreaks.</p>
	
	<p>Documentation of these discussions in the patient’s record might reduce any potential liability if a vaccine-preventable disease occurs in the unimmunized patient.</p>

	<h2>Vaccine Adverse Events</h2>
	
	<p>The <a title="Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)</a> is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC. The purpose of VAERS is to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines.  The VAERS collects and analyzes information from reports of adverse events that occur after the administration of U.S. licensed vaccines.</p>
	
	<p>Reports of adverse events are welcome from all concerned individuals, including, but not limited to:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Patients</li>
		<li>Parents</li>
		<li>Health Care Providers</li>
		<li>Pharmacists</li>
		<li>Vaccine Manufacturers</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The VAERS Reporting Form (C-76) can be found on the <a title="TVFC forms and publications page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx">TVFC forms and publications page</a>.</p>
	
	<p>All information requested on the VAERS form should be completed.  It is very important to record the vaccine manufacturer, lot number, and injection site on the VAERS form.  The VAERS form also requests the types of vaccine received, the timing of vaccination and onset of the adverse event, a description of the event, current illness or medication, past history of adverse events following vaccination, and demographic information about the recipient (age, gender, etc.).</p>
	
	<p>Adverse events following vaccination at clinics using TVFC vaccines may be reported to the DSHS Immunization Unit via fax or mail.</p>
	
	<p>The DSHS Immunization Unit fax number for VAERS reporting is <strong>(512) 776-7544</strong>.</p>

	<p>Adverse events can be reported to directly to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) by completing an <a title="online VAERS form" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/index">online VAERS form</a>.</p>
	
	<p>VAERS reporting may also be completed by mail or fax.  Contact (800) VAC-RXNS or (800) 822-7967 for information or to request pre-addressed VAERS forms.

	<h2>Vaccine Record Keeping Requirements</h2>
	<p>The 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury and Compensation Act requires providers nationwide to record specific information in the medical record each time a vaccine is administered. The following information is required:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name of vaccine administered</li>
		<li>Date vaccine was administered (month, day, year)</li>
		<li>Date vaccine information statement (VIS) was given</li>
		<li>Publication date on VIS</li>
		<li>Name of vaccine manufacturer</li>
		<li>Vaccine lot number</li>
		<li>Name and title of the healthcare provider administering the vaccine</li>
		<li>Address of the clinic where the vaccine was administered</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Immunization cards for providers (C-100) and clients (C-102 and C-104) can be ordered free of charge from the DSHS Immunizations Unit (See <a title="Ordering Forms and Literature" href="/immunize/tvfc/ordering-literature.aspx">Ordering Forms and Literature</a>). These cards are designed to capture all information required when vaccines are administered.</p>

	<h2>Decision to Not Vaccinate</h2>
	<p>Maintaining public confidence in immunizations is critical for preventing a decline in vaccination rates that can result in outbreaks of disease. While the majority of parents believe in the benefits of immunization and have their children vaccinated, some have concerns about the safety of vaccines. The concerns about vaccine safety are preventing some parents from having their children immunized. Overcoming barriers calls for both knowledge and interpersonal skills on the part of the provider. Immunization providers should have an understanding of vaccines, updated recommendations, and of reliable sources to direct patients to find accurate information. Also necessary are the skills to deal with fears and misconceptions about vaccines, and the ability to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for patients.</p>
	<p>When a parent or patient initiates discussion regarding a vaccine concern, the provider should discuss the specific concern and provide factual information. The vaccine information statements (VIS) provide an outline for discussing vaccine benefits and risk. Providers can reinforce key points regarding each vaccine, including safety, and emphasize risks encountered by unimmunized children. Parents should be informed about <a title="state laws pertaining to school or child care entry" href="/immunize/school/">state laws pertaining to school or child care entry</a>, which might require unimmunized children stay home from school during outbreaks. Documentation of these discussions in the patient's record might reduce any potential liability if a vaccine-preventable disease occurs in the unimmunized patient.</p>

	<h2>Vaccine Adverse Events</h2>
	<p>The <a title="Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)</a> is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC. The purpose of VAERS is to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines. VAERS collects and analyzes information from reports of adverse events (possible side effects) that occur after the administration of U.S. licensed vaccines.</p>
	<p>Reports are welcome from all concerned individuals: patients, parents, health-care providers, pharmacists, and vaccine manufacturers.</p>
	<p>All information requested on the VAERS form should be recorded. It is very important to record the vaccine manufacturer, lot number, and injection site on the VAERS form. The VAERS form also requests the types of vaccine received, the timing of vaccination and onset of the adverse event, a description of the event, current illness or medication, past history of adverse events following vaccination, and demographic information about the recipient (age, gender, etc.).</p>
	<p>Reports of events following vaccination at clinics using TVFC vaccine should be reported directly to DSHS.</p>
	<blockquote style="font-style:initial;"><strong>Please mail to:</strong><br/>

		MC-1946<br/>
		P.O. Box 149347<br/>

	</blockquote>
	<p>The VAERS Reporting Form (C-76) is on the <a title="TVFC publications page" href="/immunize/tvfc/publications.aspx#vaccine-inventory">TVFC publications page</a>.</p>
	<p>Reports of events following vaccination at clinics using privately purchased vaccine should be reported directly to VAERS. Adverse events may be reported online, by mail, or fax. Contact (800) VAC-RXNS or (800) 822-7967 for information or to request pre-addressed VAERS forms. More information can be obtained from the <a title="FDA web site" href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/VaccineAdverseEvents">FDA web site</a>.</p>

<h2>What is HPV?</h2>
<p>HPV is a common virus that is passed on through sexual contact. Most of the time, HPV has no symptoms; so people do not know they have it. There are many different strains or types of HPV. Some types can cause cervical cancer in women and can also cause other kinds of cancer in both men and women. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts in both males and females. Information from the <a title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HPV page" href="http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HPV page</a>.</p>

<h2>What HPV vaccines are available in the United States?</h2>
<p>Two HPV vaccines are currently licensed in the United States. One of the vaccines, Gardasil (HPV4), works against four strains of the virus and is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for both boys and girls ages 9 through 26 years. The other vaccine Cervarix (HPV2), against only two strains of the virus is only approved for use in girls ages 9 through 26 years. Both vaccines are given in 3 shots over 6 months.  </p>
<p>HPV vaccines offer greatest health benefits to individuals who receive all three doses before having any type of sexual activity. That's why HPV is recommended for preteen girls and boys at age 11 or 12 years.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Who should get the HPV vaccine?</h2>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all 11 or 12 year old girls get the 3 doses of either brand of HPV vaccine to protect against cervical cancer. Gardasil also protects against most genital warts, as well as some cancers of the vulva, vagina and anus. Girls and young women ages 13 through 26 should get HPV vaccine if they have not received any or all doses when they were younger.</p>
<p>CDC also recommends Gardasil for all boys age 11 or 12 years, and for males 13 through 21 years of age, who did not get any or all of the three recommended doses when they were younger. All men may receive the vaccine through age 26, and should speak with their doctor to find out if getting vaccinated is right for them.</p>
<p>The vaccine is also recommended for gay and bisexual men (or any man who has sex with men) and men with compromised immune systems (including HIV) through age 26, if they did not get fully vaccinated when they were younger.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Are the HPV vaccines safe and effective?</h2>
<p>The FDA has licensed the vaccines as safe and effective. Both vaccines were tested in thousands of people around the world. These studies showed no serious side effects. Common, mild side effects included pain where the shot was given, fever, headache, and nausea. As of September 2011, approximately 40 million doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine were distributed in the United States. As with all vaccines, CDC and FDA continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines very carefully.</p>

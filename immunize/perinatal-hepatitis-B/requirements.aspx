<h2>Diagnostic Testing During Pregnancy and Upon Delivery</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Testing at First Examination</h3>
<p>Providers that are permitted by law to care for a pregnant woman during gestation or at delivery of an infant shall perform hepatitis B serologic testing at the first prenatal visit and upon delivery of an infant. The test results from pregnancy shall be retained for nine months and the report delivered to any successor in the case.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Distribution of Informational Materials at Time of Testing</h3>
<p>Before the serologic sample is taken, the health care provider shall distribute to the patient printed materials about hepatitis B and document the distribution of these materials. If a screening test and a confirmatory test show that the woman is or may be infected with hepatitis B, the provider shall provide or make available to the woman disease-specific information on the disease diagnosed, including information relating to treatment, which must be in another language, if needed, and must be presented, as necessary, in a manner and in terms understandable to a person who may be illiterate if resources permit. Referral to an entity that provides treatment for hepatitis B is compliant. </p>

<h2>Who is Required to Report</h2>
<p>Physicians, advanced practice nurses, physician assistant, and persons permitted by law to attend a pregnant woman during gestation or at the delivery of an infant (such as midwives) are required to report to DSHS each patient who has or is suspected of having hepatitis B.</p>
<p>Any person who is in charge of a clinic laboratory in which a laboratory examination of any human specimen yields serologic evidence of a notifiable condition shall report as required. Failure to report a notifiable condition is a Class B misdemeanor under the Texas Health and Safety Code &#167;81.049. </p>
<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) allows reporting without authorization for public health purposes and where required by law. </p>

<p>Perinatal Hepatitis B infections in infants 24 months of age and younger shall be reported within one working day of identification as a confirmed or suspected case. </p>

This information shall be kept confidential.</p>
